            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The AUTHOR'S PREFACE TO Miniſters, Governors of Families, and People under their Charge. ESPECIALLY, To his much honoured Friends, and next Relations.</head>
            <p>THere are three things moſt worthy our Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Work and Endeavours, and moſt deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be found in the Flocks committed to our Charge and Overſight: 1. The ſaving Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth. 2. A Judgment to diſcern between Truths and Errors; eſpecially, ſuch as concern Faith and Holineſs, the Principles of the Oracles of God, and the things which accompany Salvation. 3. A gracious, lively Spirit, ſincerely devoted to God in Chriſt, and ſtrongly inclined to holy Exerciſes, and practice of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Duties. Or, if you will, take all in three ſhort
<pb facs="tcp:93290:3"/> Sentences: 1. Conviction of Judgment of Saving Truth, and damning Errors. 2. Sound Converſion to God. 3. A Converſation according to the Will of God, revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>The Church is called God's Husbandry, and God's Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>1 Cor. 3.9.</hi> and Miniſters are highly dignified, when called Workers together with God, <hi>2 Cor. 6.1.</hi> and Labourers together with God, <hi>1 Cor. 3.9.</hi> The Field is God's, the Seed is his, the Husbandry is his, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe is given by him. We are Labourers together with him, enabled by him, and working by his power and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, under him, and for him. All our Sufficiency is of God, <hi>2 Cor. 3.5.</hi> without him, we are nothing, and can do nothing. <hi>Who then is Paul? and who is Apollos? but Miniſters by whom ye believed, as the Lord gave to every man. I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increaſe. So then, neither is he that planteth any thing, nor he that watereth, but God that giveth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, 1 Cor. 3.5,6,7.</hi> As we are Husband-men, we muſt ſow and plant; but that is not all, we muſt alſo mound and fence our Fields and Plantations. As we are Builders, we muſt lay the Foundation, carry on the Building, by Edification in Faith, <hi>1 Tim. 1.4.</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Building, that it fall not, like an Houſe built upon the Sand. This Husbandry is elſewhere called a Garden, and this Building called an Houſe. How gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly doth the Moſt High condeſcend to delight himſelf in, and to be entertained by his Church, as by a <hi>Royal Spouſe,</hi> with his own Graces and Gifts, the Fruits of his Holy Spirit, when they are in Act, put forth, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, as in a <hi>Garden of Spices, and Orchard of Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates,</hi> or at a Table prepared for him! <hi>Cant. 4.14,15,16. chap. 5.1. and 1.12.</hi> What a bleſſed Life may we lead by walking with God, appearing before him, calling upon him, praiſing him, and hearing him ſpeak! There is ordinary (not mean, but rich and plentiful) and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Entertainment for hungry, feeding Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, in the Ordinances of the Goſpel. In the Goſpel there is a <hi>Feaſt prepared,</hi> and that a <hi>Wedding-Feaſt,</hi> a Wedding-Feaſt of a King's Son, his only Son, the Prince
<pb facs="tcp:93290:3"/> of Life; but they who ſit at it, muſt have a <hi>Wedding-Garment,</hi> the Ornament of Grace, Faith, Repentance and Love, a Suitableneſs of heart, and Preparation, <hi>Matth 22.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Towards this moſt deſirable End, there are three things to be found in this little Book; 1. Here are the Foundations of Faith and Godlineſs laid; a View of the Principles of Chriſtian Religion, according to the Word of God, out of which they are gathered, and by which they are proved, and agreeing with the appproved Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Reformed Churches. 2. Here are the moſt important Doctrines, briefly touched in theſe Principles, cleared, proved, deſended, and reſcued out of the hands of them who have handled the Word of God deceitfully, and have led many into the Errors of the Wicked; that the ſtudious Chriſtian may know what he ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for, and to continue in; and how to maintain his Ground. 3. Here are Directions for Practice of ſeveral great Duties of all baptized Chriſtians; 1. How to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Doctrine of the moſt holy Trinity, the Myſtery of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and his Baptiſm, or Entrance into Covenant with God. 2. Direction for Prayer, with a Prayer taken out of the Catechiſm, for the moſt part. 3. Direction for the Communion in the Lord's Supper.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Of theſe three Parts, be pleaſed to take this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Account.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some time ſince, a little Book was printed, called <hi>Principles made practical,</hi> directing the poorer, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker ſort of Chriſtians, who had learnt the ſhorter Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm, and could not buy, nor ſpare time to read other profitable Books, to make uſe of their Catechiſm, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them with matter for Prayer, and Preparation for the Lord's Table. As mean and defective as it was, it was attended with a Bleſſing to many that embraced it, as an help to them; and therein I rejoice. That Impreſſion being ſold off, and worn out in the hands of many, long ago, another Edition of it hath been much deſired, and called for from many places. I have re-viewed it, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the Faults in the Sence of it, and begged of God
<pb facs="tcp:93290:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> to open a paſſage for it; and ſeeing it was bleſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in a plain, homely dreſs, I have not at all trimmed or adorned it. To thoſe two Duties, I have now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded another Chapter, of the practical uſe of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the glorious, eternal Trinity, and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptiſm, upon theſe Conſiderations: 1. The Doctrine of the Trinity hath been, and is looked upon as a meer Speculation, under a Veil of Myſteriouſneſs; as if it were as dangerous to look into it, as it was into the Ark: Whereas, though it be an high and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Myſtery to be adored, and with profoundeſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and Humility to be ſtudied and taught, yet it is revealed by God himſelf, as the Object of our Faith and Worſhip. <note place="margin">

                  </gap>it. Unitate.</note> So God reveals himſelf in the Creation of the World, in the Creation of Man, and in the Covenant of Grace. When we are admitted into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and made viſibly free of the City of God, we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt. This Doctrine is a Fundamental of our Chriſtian Faith, and therefore to be explained to the People of God, in Covenant with him, as far as it is revealed in his Word; and that is enough for our preſent State. 2. The very Titles and Appellations of the Perſons in the Godhead in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us of the exceeding great uſefulneſs of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Trinity. Hath God revealed himſelf as a Father, and would he not have his Children know him, and be the better for it? Hath he made known himſelf, as the Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and not intend us a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Kindneſs by it? He moſt graciouſly conveys to his People the Knowledge and Aſſurance of moſt aſtoniſhing, incomprehenſible Love, Grace, Power and Goodneſs to allure and draw us into his Covenant, to oblige us to take him for our God, and become his Sons and Daughters; that we, ignorant, loſt, miſerable, helpleſs Sinners might become happy for ever in him. 3. As the Plurality of Perſons, or one God, and three Perſons are revealed to us, ſo the practical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and Benefit of it is alſo revealed;
<pb facs="tcp:93290:4"/> and therefore it is to be opened to his Covenant-people. As ſoon as we know the Covenant, and our Entrance into it, we know our God to be the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt. And this Knowledge is not laid up for the Wiſe and Learned (which hath been moſt depraved by, and loſt in thoſe proud, and ſubtile, and learned Wits in all Ages;) but laid open before the Faith of the weakeſt Believer, to whom it is revealed. <hi>I am verily perſwaded</hi> (ſaith the judicious Mr. <hi>Lawſon</hi>) <hi>that the Myſtery of the Trinity is more clearly and fully delivered in the Scripture, than we underſtand it,</hi> Theopolitica, <hi>p 32. N. 3.</hi> And I have wondred how familiarly that Man of Search and Reach, Dr. <hi>Thomas Goodwyn,</hi> ſpeaks of it, as if he ſaw how it was, in his excellent Diſcourſe of the Knowledge of God, <hi>2 Vol. Fol. We muſt humbly follow the Scripture-Light, and dive into this Deep no further than our Line doth reach; growing more and more in Grace and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, till we come to ſee him face to face, and to know him, as we are alſo known.</hi> I cannot but obſerve the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the excellent and modeſt <hi>Melancthon: Theſe things are wonderful, and above the Creature's reach.</hi> Sed ſcimus, &amp;c. <hi>But we know theſe Myſteries are revealed to the Church, that we may worſhip and call upon God aright,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Chriſt would have the ſum of the Goſpel to be comprehended in this firſt Ceremony (of Baptiſm;) wherefore he teſtifies at once, that we are received of God; and teacheth us, who God is, and what God we invocate, and what he doth beſtow upon us</hi> I baptize thee in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt; <hi>that is to ſay, I teſtifie that thou art re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the Eternal Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt; that by their Mercy and Power thou mayeſt be delivered from Sin, and eternal Death, and be endowed with Righteouſneſs and eternal Life.—He makes a Covenant with thee in Baptiſm, and affirmeth, that he is the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and that he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Son to be a Propitiation, and ſent the Holy Ghoſt to begin in thee Righteouſneſs and eternal Life.</hi> Loc. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mun. de 3. Perſonis, it. de Filio. The glorious, infinite God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, is the Object and
<pb facs="tcp:93290:5"/> Foundation of our Faith and Hope, the bottomleſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible Spring of all Grace, Promiſes, Bleſſings and Privileges granted in the New Teſtament; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo made known, we, by Faith, acknowledge him as ſuch, and promiſe Love and Obedience to him. We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the Father, through the Son, by the Holy Ghoſt, Grace and Life, even all manner of Grace; and all that are alive, live by them, upon them, and to them: Therefore again, the Knowledge of this Myſtery is practical, and neceſſary to Salvation; for except we believe, and worſhip God, as he hath revealed himſelf; except we keep Covenant with him, as God, in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and that as he hath declared himſelf therein, how can we be ſaved? By him, as thus made known, we are quickned, ſtrengthned, encouraged and comforted in all our Services, and every ſtep of Duty, in our way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

It is a great Duty, and Grace to improve it, to the Ends of it, and much neglected. Parents are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally importunate to have their Children baptized, and as generally negligent to train them up as baptized Members, in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord; and ſo we have ſo many ignorant and ungodly in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church. I wiſh what is written upon the Subject, were more common, and more underſtood, by the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Dr. <hi>S. Ford,</hi> of the practical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Infant Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm: Dr. <hi>Manton</hi>'s Sermon of the Improvement of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, in the Supplement of the <hi>Morning-Exerciſe,</hi> at <hi>Cripple gate:</hi> Mr. <hi>Joſeph Whiſton,</hi> his Eſſay to revive the primitive Practice of Infant Baptiſm: And Mr. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel Rogers,</hi> of the Sacraments, ſpeaks with Light and Life. Though having room here to ſpeak thus much in this place, for theſe things, I have ſaid but little in that firſt Chapter, becauſe limited.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the ſecond Chapter, I have ſhewed the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe which may be made of the Catechiſm, to accommodate the ſincere, fervent Soul with Matter for Prayer. It is a Temptation to neglect the Duty, when there is want of Mattter to utter before God. If any will object, that this will be to bring People to pray by rote, as they ſay their Catechiſm by rote; and to bring them to a Form: I anſwer to the firſt; this Objection may be ſet up to neglect Catechizing and Teaching, and ſo is impious and erroneous. Again, As God hath bleſſed Catechizing to his Church, ſo by often and ſerious Meditation upon the particular Points of Catechiſm, their Knowledge increaſeth, and comes to be enlarged, beyond the Words of the Catechiſm, ſo it may work upon the Affections alſo;
<pb facs="tcp:93290:6"/> and then they may alſo enlarge in Prayer, beyond the Lines of this Prayer, if they can, and when need is. But as what is neceſſary and profitable to be learnt and believed, is comprehended in the Catechiſm, ſo what is generally neceſſary to be asked, is contained in the Prayer. And they who are convinced, and believe the Truth of the Doctrine taught, according to the Scripture, will pray with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, and by Faith, believing and knowing what they pray. And if ſome are commended for turning Sermons into Prayer, I ſee as much reaſon for turning a Catechiſm into Prayer. Yea, but this is to bring them to a Form. What then? Take away Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and ſenſeleſs Cuſtomarineſs, and running a Stage, or a Round of Prayer, without Preparation, Attention, or Care, what Anſwers are made, and what can be judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly or charitably ſaid againſt a Form of Prayer? Whereas many holy, and very able Miniſters, as well as private Chriſtians, have in Judgment choſen a Form; at leaſt, ordinarily: And a Form is neceſſary to others, becauſe of Weakneſs. Do you, who object againſt all uſe of Forms, really think, that whoever is regenerate and ſanctified, hath the Spirit for <hi>Extempore</hi> Prayer; by which I mean, a preſent Ability to vary Words and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon all Occaſions? And that none have the Spirit of Chriſt, or Adoption, but ſuch as can do, or ſuch as do ſo; and that they who keep ordinarily to the ſame Matter and Words, are deſtitute of the Spirit? Or do you think that Profeſſors in theſe Days, have more of the Spirit, than holy Men had in former times? You will never be able to prove theſe things, and you are confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table by Clouds of Examples of holy and able Men, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent for Gifts. If you ſay the Spirit is limited in a Form of Prayer, take heed you do not limit the Spirit to a ſort of Men. The Spirit of Grace doth excite his own Graces in the Soul that prayeth; and thoſe Graces act according to the Capacity of them that pray; and alſo brings many things to mind, which were not thought of before; and when God brings in Matter, he doth help to utter it, but not all alike. I condemn lary, heartleſs Formality; mine own practice is known to many; but I
<pb facs="tcp:93290:7"/> honour the Name and Memory of holy and eminent Men and Fathers, who had the Spirit of Holineſs in a great meaſure, who uſed Forms on ordinary ſtated Times and Occaſions: And I would not diſcourage ſincere weak ones from uſing a good Form, leſt I diſ-hearten them from praying at all. Let me add; I do not teach any to be tied up to a Form, the ſame number of Words and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions for all times; but give Directions for Matter and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Prayer; with a Prayer, that may be daily uſed with Acceptation, if prayed with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, and Faith, and other Graces. It hath been the Study of many, and ſome of them able, good Men, much an Prayer, to publiſh Prayers fitted to ſeveral Occaſions: But, alas! what can they do, if the Hearts of them that uſe them are not fitted for them? It is not Devotion that is printed in a Book, but what is kindled in the Heart: And he is poor indeed, that hath not a Prayer for his Mouth, except his Book be in his Pocket, or before his Eyes.</p>
            <p>There is great reaſon for theſe Exhortations, <hi>Pray without ceaſing,</hi> and <hi>Continue in Prayer;</hi> for we have continual cauſe to draw near to God. And we that are Miniſters have to do with many Souls, in various Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and general Praying is no more effectual, than general Preaching: In the one, there are particular Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of the Word to Men's Hearts, from God; in the other, particular Applications to God, on the behalf of Men, according to particular Conditions. And there is a more excellent way, than making a Prayer of Patches taken out of Books of Devotion: The holy Scripture is the Prayer-book; it affords Matter for Prayer, as well as Preaching: And how can that Man preach, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pray? And this of praying with, and for particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſons in private, and alſo in publick if the Caſe require it, according to their particular Caſes, is one of thoſe, <hi>Every good Work,</hi> for which we ſhould be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, <hi>2 Tim 3.16.</hi> Thoſe Men whom God honoured moſt in the Reformation, and Edification, and Comfort of his Church, have been moſt like to <hi>Elijah</hi> for praying: And we ſhould ſtudy to ſhew our ſelves Men approved
<pb facs="tcp:93290:7"/> of God, in this part of our Miniſtry, with ſound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, heavenly Wiſdom, and holy Affections. <hi>Epaphras</hi> was wont to labour fervently in Prayer, <hi>Col. 4.12.</hi> And the Apoſtle beſought the <hi>Romans</hi> to ſtrive together with him in Prayer, <hi>Rom 15.30.</hi> But yet this ſtriving, though in ſome active Spirits, it cannot be confined to a ſet Form of Words, doth not require us to lay aſide all Forms, which many holy Men that I could name, have uſed, out of Judgment and Choice; and have prevailed with God, by Faith and Fervency. And let thoſe who ſpeak much of praying, and daily, or frequently pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and together, took well to the matter, and to their Spirits, and ſee that they do not offer the Sacrifice of Fools, nor be raſh to utter a Matter before God. And it were better with the Church of God, if we did put on Charity, if we were cloathed with Humility, if we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted leſs about Forms, and prayed more <hi>with all manner of Prayer and Supplication in the Spirit,</hi> Epheſ. <hi>6.18.</hi> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief and Hypocriſie are a dead Load upon the Heart, and keep Prayer from aſcending. When a Man's Heart is God's, and when the Prayers we make, are our own Senſe, offered up in the Name of Chriſt, by the Spirit of Adoption, according to the Will of God, we ſhall be heard. Yet I would not be underſtood, as if Prayer were not a Duty of Natural Religion, or that only regenerate Perſons ſhould pray; but they, be ſure, pray acceptably. Wrangle not your ſelves into Breaches of Communion, and Diſ-union of the Spirit; and let all things be done in Peace. And ſo I offer this Help to ſuch as need it, as God ſhall be pleaſed to make it ſerviceable. Of Forms, and <hi>Extempore</hi> Prayers, you may ſee Biſhop <hi>Downham,</hi> of the Lord's Prayer, <hi>p 137.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> Caſes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The laſt Chapter of this Part contains Directions for Self-Examination, and Preparation for the Table of the Lord; Behaviour at it, and after it. Much hath been printed upon this Subject, and yet Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants are comparatively few, and prepared ones, we fear, are fewer. The low and diſtracted, broken ſtate of the Church of Chriſt, is matter of Grief and Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
<pb facs="tcp:93290:8"/> How unlike are we to a Body animated by the ſame Spirit, joined to the ſame Head! How many live and die, grown to Years, that never taſted of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per! How many but very ſeldom! How many are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, prophane, negligent, ſtupid, do we what we can! Oh, that Longing after, and Love to Chriſt, had more power with many, than the Obſervation of Cuſtoms and Seaſons, and the Laws of Men! Some are affected with the Duty and Privilege, and ſeem earneſtly to deſire it, who fall off again. How many are afraid of it, leſt this Table of the Lord become a Snare? How many break Communion, upon diſtaſte of a Form of Adminiſtration (though very ſound,) or ſome diſ-liked Communicants, againſt whom they do not proceed as they ought? How many labour under great Deſections, Melancholy and Fear? How many put themſelves off, and abide in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſettlement; that ſeparate from publick, and do not join with other Aſſemblies? What! Do they wait for ſome higher Diſpenſation? Or do they ſeek for what is no where promiſed; or keep in ſuſpence, as afraid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new Covenant with God? Or what other Reaſon? But can they live without Communion with the Lord? How can they think of dying? How many, incorporate with particular Churches, that with hold Communion from all others, for meer Accidents and Circumſtances? Oh, take heed, leſt between <hi>this Way,</hi> and <hi>that Way,</hi> you do not keep out of the Way which the Lord himſelf hath commanded you, <hi>to ſhew forth his Death.</hi> I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice to ſee Matters of juſt and rational Offence taken away, and Acceſs to the Lord's Table to be as free and open, as the Way to Heaven is. But hour, or when ſhall it be, as long as that which is an Offence to one, is a Duty to another? Oh, let us remember our Covenant with God, our being incorporate with the Body of Chriſt, labour to grow together in him, who is not a little Head of a Sect, or Party, but of all that call upon him, in all places. I look upon Breaches in, and about, and from this holy Ordinance, next to breaking the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit, to be, of all Breaches, the moſt deadly. Let us not divide for meer Accidents, but look to the main.
<pb facs="tcp:93290:8"/> The ſubſtance of the Ordinance, and what is left, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual to the Church, is delivered us by the holy Apoſtle, <hi>who received it from the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where there is no Rehearſal of the Circumſtances of Place, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and other Accidents of the firſt Supper; but the ſtanding Ordinance and Inſtitution: And where the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is obſerved, the Ordinance is pure.</p>
            <p>The next neceſſary Injunction is, Self-Examination. Let us look more to our own Hearts, and fit them for Communion with the Body and Blood of our Lord, and we ſhall not be ſo given to divide, as we are. And as for Communicants, pray for them, admoniſh them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed regularly, make not their Sin yours, and their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence doth not pollute you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Deſign of theſe three Chapters being to carry them further on, who had been converſant in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Catechiſm, hath given occaſion to bring it forth once more to Light; with ſome few Propoſitions, to fill up ſome ſpaces between one Point, and another; and to explain them with Quotations of Scripture. It is not hard to ſee, how ſome will be offended at this, for its firſt Name and Title: But, without detracting from the <hi>Church Catechiſm,</hi> or any other Form of ſound Words, by which Chriſt hath edified his Church, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily conceal, nor expreſs my due Admiration of this.

            <p>Every Anſwer is full and clear; but that which rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth up my Heart in praiſe of God for it, is the rare De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of my glorious Redeemer, and the Doctrines that belong unto it. In them we have as much Truth
<pb facs="tcp:93290:9"/> as can be laid together; and as many Hereſies caſt out from them, as can be ſummed up in ſo few Words. There is an Antidote againſt the Priſon of <hi>Cerinthus, Ebion, Arrius, Samoſatenus, Neſtorius, Eutyches,</hi> the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and other Hereticks, which appeared with the Reformation, and gave thoſe bleſſed Souls, who were the Lights of the World, much trouble.</p>
            <p>The Harmony of the whole with the Doctrine of our Church, has been judiciouſly ſhewed by Mr. <hi>Thomas A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams;</hi> (whoſe Learning, Graces, and ſweet Temper might have been a great Bleſſing in theſe Times, if God had been pleaſed to continue him on Earth) in a Book called, <hi>Principles of Religion explained,</hi> publiſhed by his genuine, worthy Brother, <hi>Mr. R. A.</hi> And the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it with the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> is manifeſt to all that know the one, and the other; and therefore the Enmity expreſſed againſt it, moſt proceed from an ill Opinion of the firſt Compliers of it, and the Time of its Birth: But <hi>ſhall the Wrath of Men endure to all Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations?</hi> Can we forgive the Living, and never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give the Dead, who were rarely accompliſhed for ſo great a Work? Is it not time, and high time, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſie An moſtlies? And have we not great cauſe, if there be any Love to Truth, to bleſs God for cauſing ſo much pure Light to ſhine in thoſe Days of Clouds, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, Whirl-wind, Confuſion, Smoak and Fire?</p>
            <p>If I ſhould expreſs the high Eſteem the moſt Reverend Primate <hi>Uſher</hi> had for it, as I have often heard from ſeveral Perſons, I ſhould but make ſome Men think the worſe of both.</p>
            <p>The great Eſteem which hath been, and ſtill is ſhewed to it by ſome of all Ranks, makes it ſeem impoſſible to ſuppreſs it, without an Inquiſition. And let thoſe who have ſaid, it was worſe than the <hi>Racovian Catechiſm,</hi> ſpeak out; and then we know what Opinion and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction they have for this Church, and Chriſtianity it ſelf: And let them take notice now zealouſly the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the Year 1640. declared againſt <hi>Socinianiſm.</hi> So that if theſe Men, who preferr a <hi>Socinian Catechiſm;</hi> that is, to ſay plainly, an Antichriſtian Collection of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie,
<pb facs="tcp:93290:9"/> they diſſent from the whole <hi>Church of</hi> England, and the moſt zealous Antipuritan part of it. But I hope theſe Speeches were only ſpoken while the hot Fit was upon them.</p>
            <p>I could wiſh thoſe Gentlemen, who preſented a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> ſtigmatized to their hands, no doubt, to recollect themſelves, and ſee whether they were ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, as to preſent nothing but what was ſeditious in it; or whether they preſented all, from the Title-Page, to the <hi>Finis;</hi> and the very Scriptures, the Creed, the Ten Commandments, and Lord's Prayer, always printed in it. If they preſented nothing in it, but what was falſe, erroneous, ſcandalous and dangorous; then it is altogether ſafe, and untainted: But if they preſented it all together, without Reſervation of due Reverence to any Doctrine, Scriptures, Creed, Commandments, or Lord's Prayer; then all that is in it fared no worſe than the Rule of Faith it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and other ways to ſuppreſs this Book, had this unhappy Effect, that it hath widened the Separation, and increaſed Suſpicions and Jealouſies in the Minds of Men.</p>
            <p>There are many <hi>Catechiſms</hi> yet common in ſeveral parts of the Kingdom, which have never been diſ-al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in the ſtricteſt Times.</p>
            <p>It is no Derogation from the <hi>Church Catechiſm,</hi> that People grow in ſound Knowledge by larger, that may be uſed as Expoſitions of it.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Catechiſm</hi> ſpeaks for it ſelf, and the Oracles of God ſpeak for it; and I will ſay no more, but what tends to Satisfaction about the preſent Publication of it.

            <pb facs="tcp:93290:10"/>
            <p>Conſidering the Times, and danger of many, who are not well and throughly inſtructed, and are diſpoſed to take the Infection; who are forward and venturous to hear any who hath his Way prepared, and ſtrewed with Commendation; I have laboured to expel or prevent Infection, by ſhewing them how to diſcern between Truth and Error, in the Subſtantials of Religion.</p>
            <p>And ſo I have done the third neceſſary Part of an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-man, and Builder; which is, to fence and ſecure his Plantation, and Building.</p>
            <p>Every Particular, almoſt, in every Section, is a Truth reſcued out if the Hand, or Jaws of ſome heretical and erroneous Teacher, or other. Some of theſe are ſo well known, that I need not name them; and it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to name others. But becauſe I could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, I have named the <hi>Socinians,</hi> or Diſciples of <hi>Laetius,</hi> and <hi>Fauſtu Socinus;</hi> and quoted the <hi>Socinian Catechiſm,</hi> brought foth at <hi>Racovia.</hi> But why theſe? For theſe two Reaſon.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe their Doctrine is a new Goſpel, another Goſpel, which they dignifie with the Style of <hi>Saving Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;</hi> and the Embracement of this Doctrine is that by which the true Church may be known, and there is no need of enquiring after the Notes or Marks of the true Church; <hi>Cap. de Eccleſia Viſibili.</hi> They ſubvert the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Foundations of Chriſtian Faith and Hope, the holy Trinity, one God, and three Co-eſſential Perſons; or Three, but one and the ſame God. They acknowledge the Names, but diſown the Perſons: <hi>There is but one Perſon, and that is the Father.</hi> They own the Son, and Holy Goſt; but then make the Father, and the Son not to be of the ſame Nature and Eſſence; and deny the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt to be God, or a Perſon in the Godhead. And ſo they make us, who are created by one that is God, to be but redeemed and ſaved by one that is not God; and made new Creatures, and ſanctified by one who is not God, ſave by Title. They take away the glorious Crown of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Godhead from the Head of God my Saviour, and lay that Honour in the Duſt of Manhood, though they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him more than a meer Man, a Divine Man,
<pb facs="tcp:93290:11"/> and only a Subordinate to God; a meer Inſtrument, a ſecond Cauſe of Salvation; an Helper, but not a perfect Saviour; a great Prophet, an improper Prieſt, and a little King. I am ſure, according to their Doctrine, I muſt look for another Chriſt; for ſuch an one as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, cannot do, for my Salvation, what my State re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. But bleſſed be God the Father, the Son, and Holy Ghoſt, for making himſelf known to me in the Glaſs of holy Scripture; and in Honour, Love and Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I have, where ever Occaſion is offered, vindicated the Glory of God my Saviour, and of God my Sanctifier. And for their Subtilty in managing their Cauſe, I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily think they have loſt it, by one Conceſſion of theirs, which you may ſee in the ſecond and third Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; where I have ſpoken but briefly, yet, I hope, not obſcurely. I have mainly ſet my little Strength againſt them principally; but I hope God's Power will be ſeen in my Weakneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the reverend and judicious <hi>Joſias Simder</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that out of the School of that impure <hi>Servetus</hi> went forth thoſe egregious Diſciples, <hi>Gonaeſius, Gribul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, Blandrata, Gentilis, Paul Alciatus, Gregorius Paulus, Caſanovius, Menno,</hi> and numerous Troops of <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> who all differed in ſome things from one another, <hi>(Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctat. de Aeterno Dei Filio;)</hi> ſo moſt of our differing Sects are corrupted with ſome Points or other of <hi>Socinianiſm;</hi> and not only among them is this Infection ſpread, but others alſo. <hi>In the</hi> Aſphaltes <hi>of</hi> Socinianiſm, <hi>all flow together;</hi> Gebal, <hi>and</hi> Amon, <hi>and</hi> Amalek, Anabaptiſts, Remonſtrants, Separatiſts, <hi>and</hi> Quodlibetiſts, ſaid Dr. <hi>Prideaux, Lect 19.

And one <hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrine is of dargerous tendency to corrupt the Minds of Men, who are for Liberty of Propheſying of gifted Men, that they hold, there is no neceſſity of a Calling, Miſſion, or Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Miniſters, <hi>Capit. 2. de Eccleſ. Chriſti.</hi> They can furniſh them who are diſpoſed to cavelling, with Cavels and Objections enough, ſuited to proud, corrupt Nature, and many Opinions grown too common. And Men that are devoted to Reaſon, but never felt the two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged Sward of Conviction of Sin and Wrath, and of their need of a Saviour enter into their Souls, are apt to venerate them as the Oracles of Reaſon. What I have done, or can do, is but little; yet I truſt, Truth will be ſeen in its own Light, and found to ſtand upon its own ſtrong Foundation.</p>
            <p>I was confined to Brevity; and it is not eaſie to me, who am uſed to expatiate, to make things plain to every Capacity, to be clear, ſhort and ſtrong, Had I fore-ſeen there had been ſo many Half-lines, as I ſee there is, I would have filled up my Senſe in ſome places; but now that cannot be.</p>
            <p>Such as it is, I do moſt humbly dedicate it to my God and Maſter in Heaven; and for your Service, my much, and moſt honoured Brethren, Friends and deareſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. Accept of this, as a Preſent, a profitable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for many Favours and Bleſſings received from you. I beſeech you, continue your Care and Pains in inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Families: Build up your ſelves and them in your holy Faith; and as you were educated your ſelves, go on to train up yours: And the Grace of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus

               <p>SHewing, 1. what is Mans chief End. 2. The way to it.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <p>I. Mans chief End, is either, 1. The chief End of Intention what he ought to aim at above all things, as the Scope of his Life and Actions, that is, to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify God. Or, 2. Mans chief End of Fruition, his chiefeſt Good and Happineſs; and that is, to enjoy God for ever.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <p>II. The Way to attain this chief End, is by the holy Scriptures. The Scriptures principally teach, 1. What Man is to believe. 2. What God requires Man to do. 3. What Man may, and ought to ask of God, and pray for. The Scriptures are a Rule of Faith, a Rule of Life and manners, a Rule of Prayer.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="subsection">
                     <p>I. The Scriptures teach what Man is bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. 1. Concerning God. 2. Concerning himſelf.</p>
                     <p>1. Concerning God, Man is to believe. 1. What God is in his Eſſence or Being, and Attributes. 2. What he is in Relation to himſelf, as the Eſſence ſubſiſteth in three Perſons; the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghoſt. 3. What God is in Relation to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in general, and to Man in ſpecial, of whom the Scriptures principally ſpeak. God is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in reference to Man, 1. As Creator. 2. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver. 3. Governor. 4. Redeemer. 5. Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor and gracious Rewarder. 2. Man is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, as 1. a Creature. 2. as a defective, needy, inſufficient Creature, and ſinful. 3. As under Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb facs="tcp:93290:15"/> as a Subject governed by Law, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. 4. As redeemed; under which conſider, 1. Mans Sin. 2. Mans Miſery. 3. Mans Inability to recover or reſtore himſelf. Concerning our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, Note, 1. The way, by which by a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace. 2. The Perſon, by whom, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Concerning this Redeemer, obſerve, 1. who, and what he is. 2. His Office in general, a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator. A Mediator in three Offices: 1. A Prophet. 2. a Prieſt. 3. a King, in a twofold State, of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation and Exaltation. 3. The Application of Redemption by the Holy Spirit. The Redemption is applied in effectual Calling. They who are called, are juſtified, ſanctified, and adopted. And theſe are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of great Benefits from Chriſt, in this Life, at Death, after Death, at the Reſurrection, and in Heaven for ever.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="2" type="subsection">
                     <p>II. The Scriptures teach what Man is obliged to do, to pleaſe and glorify God; and that is Obedience to the moral Law; which Law ſhews what we ought to do, and what we ought not to do. But Man hath tranſgreſſed this Law, and is fallen under the Wrath and Curſe of God. The Scriptures further teach what is to be done to eſcape the Wrath of God; which is, 1. Faith in Jeſus Chriſt. 2. Repentance to Life, towards God. 3. A diligent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of means, which are, 1. The Word heard and read. 2. The Sacraments, Baptiſm, and the Supper of the Lord. 3. Prayer.</p>

                  <div n="3" type="subsection">
                     <p>III. What Man ought to pray for, taught generally in the Scriptures; particularly in the Lord's Prayer, The Sum of all is, our higheſt End and the way to it: the way to it is by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt (with its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct Repentance) which we are taught in our Creed. 2. By Love and Obedience, the Sum of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. 3. By Invocation, taught by our Saviour.</p>

I am certain, that I was come into the World before I knew of my coming. 2. I am certain I made not my ſelf; I was, before I knew my ſelf to be what I am. 3. I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain my Parents and other Perſons, and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were in being before me. 4. I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that no Being is ſo likely to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and all other things, as Man is, becauſe he is a rational Being, of great invention and contrivance. 5. No Men of this inquiſitive and learned Age pretend to make, or to be
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93290:52"/> preſent at the making of the admirable frame of the Univerſe; and if any Man or Men of former Ages had made the World, we of this Age ſhould have found them in it. For, 1. They who could make themſelves, could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve themſelves. 2. They who could make themſelves and the World, muſt needs be great and happy. 3. They who were once great and happy, and always continued to be ſo. For, 1. if they did depoſe, or diveſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their happineſs freely and of choice, they were defective in Wiſdom, to exchange a happy Being for a leſs happy, or for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and by conſequence were not wiſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make the World. 2. If they grew weary of themſelves, they were not happy. 3. If they were conſtrained to unmake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they were not ſuperior, but ſubject to other Powers. Therefore I believe there were no ſuch Men, no ſuch ſelf-makers, and makers of other things. I conclude that I am made by another, who made all things elſe; and he is the firſt infinite Cauſe, in which my thoughts, and belief do reſt, who is infinitely Wiſe, Great, and Good, to whom be glory for ever.</p>
               <p>Again, it is impoſſible to prove, there is no God; for all things are <hi>mediums,</hi> to prove <hi>that he is,</hi> and there is no <hi>medium</hi> to prove <hi>that he is not.</hi> Laſtly, all Men Die; they who are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and willing do believe in God, they who are unwilling cannot refuſe to Die, therefore there is a Superior Power, that is Lord of <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Death;</hi> and he is the living God.</p>

               <head>SECT. II. Of the Holy Scriptures.</head>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <head>The Scriptures are of God.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. NO Man can know the mind and will of the infinite God, Creator and Governor of the World, except he be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make it known. That his will ſhould be known, is neceſſary, or elſe we could not worſhip, nor pleaſe him by doing his Will.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Beſides the light of Nature, we have his will made know by revelation; by which God, who made the World, is ſo revealed and declared, that as ſure as I am that God made the World ſo ſure am I that God gave the Scriptures to direct us in the way of Duty, and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I find the Book of God in the poſſeſſion of his Church and People, like a Royal Charter in a City, by which the City is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and governed, and enjoy their privileges. When I peruſe the Charter, I know it to be the King's, and no private Mans invention, or forg'd inſtrument. I know the great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the City of God to be his Word.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By the matter of it. For inſtance, Who can deſcribe, or declare the infinite God by his Glorious Names, and Titles, and attributes, but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93290:53"/> himſelf? Who can declare his relation to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? Who can preſcribe his Worſhip, make Laws, ſet down rewards, and declare what ſhall be in the World to come, but himſelf?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I obſerve the Style and Manner of ſpeaking, the manner of revealing, the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſent of the Old and New Teſtament, tho given the one ſo long before the other, the ſcope of the whole, their perfection, and efficacy, as able to make a Man Wiſe to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. by the operation of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <head>Authority of the Scriptures.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. The Scriptures derive their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, from God their Author. The Church is not the Author of the Scriptures, therefore they derive not their Authority from it. The Teſtimony and Tradition of the Church, is but Miniſterial. We are directed to place our faith in the Word, as it is Gods, who gave it by inſpiration, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <head>Apocrypha not Scripture.</head>
                  <p n="2">2. The Books called the <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor the Pſalms, nor the <hi>Prophets,</hi> therefore not Scriptures given by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93290:53"/> inſpiration. See <hi>Luke</hi> 24.4.27.44. nor were they committed to the Church, or kept by it, as the Oracles of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <head>The Scriptures are a perfect rule.</head>
                  <p n="3">3. The Scriptures are able to make a Man Wiſe to Salvation, and to make the Man of God (the Miniſter of God, the New Teſtament Prophet) perfect and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſhed to all good Miniſterial Works; therefore they are a perfect rule for Doctrine, Worſhip, and Manners.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Unwritten Traditions of the Church, are not of equal authority, nor to be received with the ſame pious affection, with the Holy Scriptures. Thoſe Doctrines which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by one teacher to another, or by Oral Teaching to the Church, are now written, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.15. As much as our Lord thought neceſſary, <hi>John</hi> 20.30. and ſufficient, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.16. are writen. Our faith is limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to things written, <hi>Jo.</hi> 20.31. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. Theſe traditions pleaded for, were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to faithful Men, nor faithfully kept by Men who ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt. We have enough, and our Lord would not leave us too much, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.25. Had we been bound to believe more, more had been written.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Holy Scriptures are plain in all
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93290:54"/> things neceſſary to ſalvation; clear as the Sun to thoſe uſes intended by our Lord, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19.8. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.105,131. They are a ſhining light, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. If they were not clear, how could <hi>Timothy</hi> know them as he did, from a Child? 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. How could the <hi>Bereans</hi> examine Doctrines by them? <hi>Acts.</hi> 17.11. There are ſufficient means to help the unlearned to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſo much as to make them wiſe to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. to 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.29. to 37.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The laity, or common People ought to have the free uſe of the holy Scriptures. God ſpake to all, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.46. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.1,2,6,7,8. <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.7. <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.11,12. The laity are to be ſaved by faith in Chriſt, and his word; and the Scriptures were written to direct and help them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.31. All were wont, or commanded to ſearch them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39. All are bleſſed that meditate in them, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 1.1,2. They are part of the ſpiritual armour for all Chriſtians, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.17. Unleſs we ſhould expect the Prieſts and the Learned would fight for the laity, and ſave them the trouble of that warfare.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The tranſlation of the Scriptures is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, approved of God, and ordain'd by him: except there ſhould be but one language a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men, or that none ſhould believe and be ſaved, but them who underſtood the Original. God ſpake in a known Tongue, ſo did the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, and they who did not are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.9,12,13. &amp;c. The Apoſtles ſent to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93290:54"/> preach to all Nations, had the gift of Tongues, that every Nation might receive the Goſpel in their own language: The end of writing is the ſame with ſpeaking.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Scriptures tranſlated and copied from the Originals, or firſt writings under the hands of the Scripture-pen-men, are the word of God, the foundation and rule of Faith. The Scriptures read in the Synagogues, and in common uſe among the Jews, were but copies tranſcribed; yet our Saviour refers the Jews to them, <hi>John.</hi> 5.39. The Eunuch had no other, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. nor the <hi>Bereans, Act.</hi> 17.11. The <hi>Epheſians</hi> were <hi>Greeks,</hi> and probably had the Greek tranſlation, and yet they were built upon the foundation of the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles, Epheſ.</hi> 2.20. God being the God of every one who believeth and ſhall be ſaved of every Nation, as well as of the <hi>Jews,</hi> hath taken care, and doth to ſtir up, and fit holy Men, tho not infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were, for this work; and wherein ſome have failed, others have help'd. We give a ſecondary honour to Tranſlations as ſuch, but an equal honour to the word of God tranſlated, which we give to it in the Original; the change of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage doth not alter the will of God. An Embaſſy delivered by an Interpreter is the Kings Embaſſy.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The beſt interpreter of the Word, is the Holy Spirit. Knowledge in Original Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages is neceſſary to a tranſlator, and to Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors or Teachers, for their better teaching.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93290:55"/> But he who hath moſt of the Holy Spirit, doth beſt underſtand the mind of the Spirit. All have theſe helps to underſtand them. 1. The Grammar, and plain literal ſence: the ſcope, coherence, and continual reading, with prayer, and comparing hard places with plain, help us to underſtand the Scriptures. 2. Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal reaſon, and true, with undeceived ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, help us to underſtand many Doctrines. See <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15,16. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.32. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.17,18.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. There is no viſible, ſtanding, infallible Judge of controverſies in Faith and Religion: And there is no need of any, becauſe there is none conſtituted. In a great controverſy the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves did ſearch the Scriptures, and inquire into the mind of the Holy Ghoſt, and conſented to it, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.15,28. The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt is the infallible Judge, and he ſpeaks in the word, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.24,25. The Scriptures themſelves judge, as the Law doth in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies among Men. There is a miniſterial publick judgment for edification, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4 6,7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6. and a private judgment of diſcerning, given by the holy Spirit to believers, without which they could not diſcern truth from error, nor believe, nor try the Spirits, nor judge of what is ſpoken to them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.10. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.1,2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.15.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The Holy Scriptures are not mute and dumb. Speech and voice are attributed to them, and God ſpeaks by them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. It ſaith to them that are under the Law, <hi>Iſaias</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:93290:55"/> (now dead) crieth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.27. ſee <hi>ver.</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. The Scriptures are not a dead letter; the Law is ſo called in oppoſition to the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. yet it killeth, and therefore is no dead letter void of power; it is the Miniſtry of condemnation, denouncing death againſt tranſgreſſors, <hi>v.</hi> 7. and the Goſpel is the power of God; therefore no dead letter.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. There is a Divine efficacy, and power in the Scriptures, in their kind, as the means, and inſtruments of Salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. They are able to make a Man wiſe unto Salvation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. And the ſword of the Spirit, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.</hi> 6.17.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. The Scriptures are the word of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.17. by which we underſtand the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word, and not Chriſt. See alſo <hi>Mar.</hi> 7.13. compared with <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.6.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. The Holy Spirit is the principal cauſe of all the knowledge and wiſdom to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which any Man hath, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.17. What was given by the ſpirits inſpiration, is underſtood by his illumination; a natural underſtanding cannot ſee.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. The promiſe of the ſpirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.13. doth not intimate ſuch a diſpenſation as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Holy uſe of Scriptures. They are given by inſpiration, and to continue in their uſe to the end of the World, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.18. The Spirit will not nullify his own work.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. The Scriptures are of the ſame uſe to us, and all Ages to come, which they were of to them that firſt received and believed them.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93290:56"/> They are written that we ſhould believe them, that ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.31. They are profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for all things, for all good works, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot be wiſe to Salvation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15,16,17. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1,2,3,4.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. The authority of the Old Teſtament is equally Divine with the New. All Scripture is given by inſpiration of God, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. They mutually prove one another, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.44. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.22,23. <hi>chap.</hi> 24.14. A proof from the Old Teſtament is as good as any from the New; both make up one perfect Canon and Rule of Faith.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Conſequences clearly, or immediately drawn from Scripture, or by clear natural light, are Divine, for they are contained in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. Thoſe conſequences drawn by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and <hi>Peter,</hi> to prove the fundamental Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Reſurrection, are now part of Scripture, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.32. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.30,31. and were virtually contained in the Scriptures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. If we can draw conſequences from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures by ſound <hi>Mediums,</hi> in imitation of them, what we prove by ſuch conſequences is true, and to be believed.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. The ſence of Scripture is but one, plain and ſimple, to imform, and fettle our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and faith; and not ambiguous to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found us, or keep us in doubts. When the Scriptures ſpeak plainly and properly, the ſence is proper; when by metaphors and figures, then it is plainly ſo. If the ſence were ambiguous how
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93290:56"/> could they be underſtood? how could they ſerve for Doctrine or for conviction of Error? but they are profitable to thoſe and other ends, therefore plain, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16,17.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. There are no contradictions in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, for they are all given by inſpiration of God, who cannot contradict himſelf. If any contradiction appears, it is becauſe our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings cannot reach their coherence.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. Divine. Revelation, and right reaſon, are different lights from the ſame father of light. There is nothing therefore in Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to right reaſon. To bring matters revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to be judged by reaſon, is to bring the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, before the tribunal of Man, who is both blind, corrupt, and partial; and to make the Reaſon of Man, now in a corrupted ſtate, to be more Divine and certain than Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.8. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.17,18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. There is the greateſt reaſon in the World to believe what God hath revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Right reaſon and revelation agree; where Scripture is contrary to reaſon, the reaſon is not good.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. God hath taken care to preſerve Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Scriptures from being loſt. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are perfect, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15,16,17. If any were loſt, the reſt would be imperfect. If not one jot or tittle ſhall paſs away from the Law till all be fulfilled, the whole Law, and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſafe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.18.</p>

               <head>SECT. III. Of the Trinity.</head>
               <p>THE Doctrine of the moſt glorious Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is fundamental, and practical, becauſe we are baptized in the Name of the <hi>Father,</hi> and of the <hi>Son,</hi> and of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Our Chriſtian faith and hope is built upon them; we receive Gifts and Bleſſings from them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and from each one diſtinctly; and we glorify and worſhip them together, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, as being devoted Servants to God the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> This myſtery is known only by Revelation. There is enough in nature to make it credible; and the practical uſe of it, is to be made known, as well as the truth of it to be proved, by the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. Concerning it, obſerve, 1. There are three Relatives, or Perſons in the God-head. 2. What a Perſon in the God-head is. 3. Theſe three are one God, in Being or Eſſence, co-eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential, and co-equal; for there can be no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality in the ſame infinite God-head, or Eſſence.</p>
               <div n="1" type="observation">
                  <p>I. There are three, This is acknowledged by the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who pronounce them to be no <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who do not believe it. <hi>Racov-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tech. c.</hi> 1. But they deny that there are three Perſons in the God-head, becauſe a Perſon is <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentia individua intelligens,</hi> an individual intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Being: But this reaſon is not good: It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93290:57"/> that becauſe a Perſon in the God-head, is not like a Perſon in Nature, therefore there are no diſtinct Perſons or Relatives in the God-head. Concerning theſe three, obſerve,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They are nam'd together, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. and apart, in many Scriptures by their ſeveral different Names. Theſe three are more than one. They ſay there is but one Perſon in the God-head, and that is the <hi>Father.</hi> But the <hi>Father</hi> is not every one of theſe three; there are two more diſtinctly named beſides him. The <hi>Father</hi> is not the <hi>Son,</hi> nor the <hi>Son</hi> the <hi>Father;</hi> nor is the <hi>Father,</hi> nor the <hi>Son,</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is not the <hi>Father,</hi> nor the <hi>Son.</hi> If the <hi>Father</hi> be a Perſon ſo is the <hi>Son,</hi> and ſo is the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> The <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> are two and not one, and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is a third. If the <hi>Father</hi> relate to the <hi>Son</hi> as <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> relate to the <hi>Father</hi> as <hi>Son,</hi> (as they do) then they are diſtinct Perſons, and then there are alſo more Perſons than one; and as the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> are two, the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt</hi> is a third: Not a quality of God, for there are no accidents in God; and if he were a power or a quality, there would be no need of naming him as diſtinct from the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> for he would be included in the <hi>Father,</hi> as the power of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Theſe three are diſtinctly named in our Baptiſm, which is a covenanting action, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity. Covenants are between Perſons. The God of Grace, who takes a number of Perſons into Covenant with himſelf, doth declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93290:58"/> to them, that they may know to whom they are obliged, and related in Covenant. Our great duty is to believe in God, to honour and ſerve him, and to expect what he hath promiſed. He reveals himſelf as our God in Covenant; and that not only as God, but as <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> We are oblig'd in the ſame duties to the <hi>Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> as to the <hi>Father,</hi> and partake of Grace, Love and Communion, from each one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.2,3.

                  <p n="3">3. Perſons are known by perſonal proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and actions.

The property and action of the <hi>Father</hi> is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get: The <hi>Son</hi> is called the firſt begotten, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. The Divine nature is unchangeable and indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and not multiplicable; therefore there is no proper action nor paſſion, as in nature, nor production of new Being in this eternal Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; the manner of which is not revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.

                        </gap>,</hi> and from them we borrow the word <hi>Perſon.</hi> There is great reaſon why we ſhould retain the word, tho' we will not divide from any for the uſe of a Term, that acknowledge what is reveal'd in Scripture, and can expreſs the truth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. A Perſon in the Eternal God head tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends a Perſon in Nature. A Perſon in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is uſually deſined or deſcribed to be, a Compleat, Perfect, Singular, Living, Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Being, or Subſtance, ſubſiſting by it ſelf, not ſuſtained by another, nor a part of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. The Perſons in the God-head, differ from a Created Perſon, as will appear in theſe particulars. 1. Every particular Man partakes of the ſame common, general and ſpecial Nature, but theſe particulars cannot be one Man, but every Perſon in the God-head is that one, only living and true God. 2. As Perſons are multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in Nature, ſo the nature is multiplyed in Perſons: but there is but one God; the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine eſſence is one, and not multiplied. 3. One
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93290:59"/> Perſon in nature is not another, nor in another, but the <hi>Father</hi> is in the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> in the <hi>Father,</hi> and yet diſtinguiſhed, <hi>John</hi> 10.38. <hi>chap.</hi> 14.11. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21. 4. One Perſon in nature is not only diſtinguiſhed from another, but is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from another in time, and place and many other reſpects. But, 1. The God-head or God being eternal, the Perſons in the God-head, are Co-eternal, none is before the other. 2. Where one is, the other is, the nature being indiviſible. The <hi>Son</hi> is where the <hi>Father</hi> is, tho' the humane Nature be not Omnipreſent. 3. What the one hath the other hath, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.15. All that the <hi>Father</hi> hath are mine, ſaid the <hi>Son;</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> hath what the <hi>Son</hi> hath. He ſhall take of mine, and ſhall ſhew it unto you. 4. If you know the <hi>Son</hi> you know the <hi>Father</hi> alſo, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.4. <hi>chap.</hi> 14.9,10,11. 5. What one doth the other doth, <hi>John</hi> 5.19. None of theſe things can be affirmed of different Perſons in humane Nature. The three Perſons in the Divine eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence muſt not be meaſured by individuals, or ſingular Perſons in Nature, but as one Perſon is really diſtinguiſhed from another by a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal property, ſo becauſe the <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> are ſo diſtinguiſhed, we call them Perſons, tho improperly, in a ſence peculiar to them. Now a Perſon in the God-head is God as related to himſelf. I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive it thus; God the <hi>Father</hi> is related to God the <hi>Son,</hi> and God the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> God the <hi>Son</hi> is related to God the <hi>Father,</hi> as a <hi>Son</hi> to a <hi>Father,</hi> and to God the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> And God
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93290:59"/> the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is related to the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son.</hi> You ſaw before the relative property of each Glorious Perſon. A Perſon in the Trinity is not a compound of an eſſence, and a proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for the Divine Nature is infinitely perfect, moſt pure, ſimple or uncompounded. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is eternal and primary: They bear a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary relation to the Creatures, as Creator, Redeemer, Comforter. This was intended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time, but actual in time. And to remove all groſs imaginations of the incomprehenſible Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Perſons, tho' we take Perſon and Body, in our Language for the ſame, let us take heed of imagining, three Bodies, when we ſay three Perſons.</p>

               <div n="3" type="observation">
                  <p>III. Theſe three Glorious Perſons are one God, in eſſence.</p>
                  <p>1. It is moſt certain there is one God, and but one, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 44.8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.4. 2. It is certain, there are three Perſons, as explained. 3. The father is confeſſedly that one God, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.4. It is as true that the <hi>Son,</hi> the word, is God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1. and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is God, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.4. Therefore theſe three are that one infinite God. It is contrary to reaſon, to ſay, there are three Gods: It is not contrary to reaſon, that theſe three ſhould be one, becauſe it is revealed, and they muſt be one God, or not God at all; for there is not to us <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> nor to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind more than one God.</p>
                  <p>But before I produce more evidence for this truth, I make hold to premiſe. Suppoſe an <hi>Infidel</hi> ſhould deſire a <hi>Socinian</hi> to inſtruct him
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93290:60"/> in the nature of the true God, and to ſhew him the eſſential difference between God, and all Creatures whatſoever: Surely he muſt ſhew him, how God hath made himſelf known. And how is that? but by his Glorious Names, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tules, Properties, Attributes, and Operations which are above the power of Creatures, and by which Creatures are produced. Now if the very ſame Characters by which he declares the true God to an <hi>Infidel,</hi> be aſcrib'd to the <hi>Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> then, as his demonſtration of the nature of God is good, ſo our demonſtration of the eſſential Deity of the <hi>Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> muſt needs be as good. If Chriſt be God by donation of eminent power, office, or near con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with God; if the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> be a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or God by office, they are but Creatures; and if Creatures, tho the higheſt, have thoſe properties which are eſſential to God, then it will follow, God hath nothing peculiar to his own infinite Being; which is impious, and irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional. But God is diſtinguiſhed from all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the properties of God are truly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> therefore they are the true God, and not Creatures.</p>

                        <p>3. The immediate and eſſential difference between God, and the Creatures is, that he is their Maker, and that they are cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated. The Creation of the World, is the proper Work of God, without Inſtrument or Co-worker, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 33.9. for he ſpake, and it was done, &amp;c, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 148.5. If there were an inſtrument, that inſtrument was either infinite or finite: not infinite, for the infinite is the firſt cauſe, and the inſtrument cannot be the firſt cauſe: nor was it finite, for a finite inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot receive power to produce ſo vaſt an effect, as exceeds its capacity. The <hi>Son</hi> is not the inſtrument of the <hi>Father,</hi> by whom he made all things, nor the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> He that made all things is God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. I am the Lord that ſpreadeth abroad the World by my ſelf, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 44.24. By my ſelf, how? not as by an inſtrument, but by no other than my ſelf. Or who was with me? ſee <hi>Iſ.</hi> 45.6,7.

                     <p n="1">1. God is one indiviſible eſſence, therefore there can be no participation of it; therefore <hi>Christ</hi> is not the Son of God by participation of ſome degree of the God-head, or in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. God is called the God of Gods, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates are called Gods, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 50. 1. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 82. But no where called <hi>Jehovah,</hi> nor ſaid to create the World; by him Kings Reign, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.15. therefore they are not as much God, as he is.</p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:93290:62"/>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt</hi> affirmed, <hi>I</hi> and the <hi>Father</hi> are one, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.30. that he did the work of God, <hi>v.</hi> 37. That the <hi>Father</hi> was in him, 38. which is more, than that he was ſanctified and ſent into the World. He was Man, but more than Man.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We do not ſay, that the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> are God, meerly becauſe they are joined with the <hi>Father</hi> in the form of Baptiſm. But far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 1. We are Baptized into the Name of God as God in Covenant. 2. When meer Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are joined with God, the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and them is made known; but here the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> are joined with the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> as our God and ſuperiors: An order is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, but no inferiority. 3.

                     <hi>Adam</hi> was in a condition to covenant with God, for he had perfect knowledge of what he did.

                  <p>ORiginal Sin is ſo called, becauſe it was the firſt Sin, derived from the beginning, and becauſe it is the ſpring and Original of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Sin in us.</p>

               <div type="subsection">
                  <head>Wherein it conſiſteth.</head>
                  <p>Original Sin conſiſteth, 1. in the guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt Sin. That Sin which brought Death upon <hi>Adam</hi> as a puniſhment, brought it ſo alſo upon us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. His other actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Sins are not imputed to us, for he ſtood no longer in the publick capacity of a Head, and Covenanter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the want of Original righteouſneſs. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> loſt it for himſelf, and for his Poſterity alſo. By entertaining the temptation to eat,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93290:66"/> and the firſt motion to Sin, he gave place to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and ſo he loſt what he had; and covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once what was forbidden, he afterwards coveted more evil, and Satan followed him with temptations to ſin more. The want of righteouſneſs was his Sin, and Puniſhment alſo. And it is a Sin in mankind and Puniſhment upon us ſtill. The want of it is a Sin in us, for we are bound to love God with all the heart, which we cannot do for want of it: And it is a Puniſhment upon us, and God is not bound to reſtore the righteouſneſs, and take off the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the corruption of our whole nature. All the powers of our Souls are corrupted as well as our ſenſual appetites, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.5,6. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. This is Sin working all manner of concupiſcence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.8. <hi>Adam</hi>'s habitual corruptions and vices followed upon his actual offence, by his own and Satan's doing, and Gods juſt judgment. Our actual offences, proceed from our natural and habitual corruptions. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> ſinned and forfeited for himſelf and us, who are as much his Poſterity, as <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> were. And God by a righteous Act hath concluded all under Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.31. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. This cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is fitly called the Old Man in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the New Man, which is from <hi>Chriſt</hi> by the regeneration of the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.22. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.9.

With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the image of God, what is Man but a young Inſidel? he loves Self better than God, and wanting the guidance of knowledge and wiſdom, and ſtay of holineſs in himſelf, he ſinneth of his own being an active Creature, and tempted by Satan, and the World. He is corrupted in his nature, or he could not imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.

               <head>SECT. X. Of the Miſeries of Men by the Fall.</head>
               <p>SInful Man is a miſerable Creature. I ſhall not ſpeak of all the miſeries the World groans under, only take notice of two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Death is a puniſhment of Sin, as you heard before. God reſerv'd in his own will and power how far this puniſhment ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted. They who are redeemed from eternal Death ſuffer a temporal, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. as a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for Sin, and for no other cauſe. Death was not known before it was menaced. If Death had been the condition of nature, it had followed nature in time; it might have been foretold, but not threatned as a puniſhment for Sin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The pains of Hell. To teach Men that Death eternal, and not temporal, was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Adam;</hi> and that eternal Death is but the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93290:67"/> continuation of temporal, is to tempt Men to deſpiſe temporal death, and in their diſtreſſes to make away themſelves, to put an end to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of this Life. Then the ſenſual voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Man might ſay, Let us eat and drink for to morrow we ſhall die; and the miſerable ſufferer will ſay, I will die rather than live in miſery: And if eternal Death be but ſuch a privation of Life, that I ſhall never be reſtored to Life when I am once Dead, I had rather never live again than live again to be miſerable. What work would <hi>Socinianiſm</hi> make in the World, if it be propagated, and entertained? It is too far gone; but they pretend the Glory of God for it: For how can it conſiſt with the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and goodneſs of God, to puniſh and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Men in Hell for ever, for the Sins, ſollies and vanities of a ſhort Life? To anſwer this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and clear the proceedings of Divine Judgment, I humbly offer theſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is ſelf-love, partiality, and hard thoughts of God at the bottom of this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Men are more ſenſible of their juſt ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, than of the ſinfulneſs of Sin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is no more unrighteouſneſs in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and execation, than in the conſtitution of Gods Government and Laws. The great day appointed, will be a day of judgment, and not injuſtice, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.31. The ſentence will be righteous, therefore ſo will the execution of it be. They who do ſuch things are worthy of Death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. The Judge of all the Earth will do right, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.25.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:93290:67"/>
               <p n="3">3. It was juſt that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould die, for he knew the Law, and the threatning: Is it not as juſt that the wicked ſhould be condemned to Hell, who take no warning, nor counſel?</p>
               <p n="4">4. A Sinners heart is eternally turn'd away from God. It is juſt in God to ſentence him to depart from him for ever, who will never of himſelf turn unto him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We are not ſit to judge in Gods cauſe, for we know not the heinouſneſs of Sin, nor the diſhonour of God; and we are ignorant, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and corrupted parties. Parties are no meet judges.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If we can never repair the diſhonour done to God by ſin, is it not juſt we ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for ever?</p>
               <p n="7">7. There is a proportion between the Sins of a finite Creature committed againſt the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite God, and the puniſhments inflicted by an infinite God upon a finite offender.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Is it juſt, if a magiſtrate puniſh by Death, who can never reſtore the malefactor to Life, for momentany ſins? why then ſhall God be thought unjuſt to puniſh with eternal Death?</p>
               <p n="9">9. It is moſt certain, God will do nothing to his own diſhonour, and knows how to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy his goodneſs, and juſtice.</p>
               <p n="10">10. By Gods judgments ſeverally pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon the Criminals, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.13,20. it is clear that God doth obſerve a juſt rule and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in puniſhment. He doth not puniſh all alike.</p>
               <p n="11">11. They can deſerve no leſs, who now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93290:68"/> goodneſs, and forbearance, and Death it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The mediator between God and Man, will judge between God and Man. He who took our Nature will not wrong the worſt of Men.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Humbly obſerve the judgment to come, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41. &amp;c, where note, 1. The judge cannot be excepted againſt, by the worſt of Sinners. 2. The wicked are perſons who ſhall live for ever. 3. For the fire is everlaſting. 4. Everlaſting fire is everlaſting puniſhment. 5. If the puniſhment be everlaſting, the ſuffering ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors will be everliving. To die eternally, is not, therefore, to be extinguiſhed, or to ceaſe to be, but to be miſerable for ever.</p>
               <p>From what is ſaid, it follows, 1. That con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence is Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7,17,20,22,23. 2. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Sin is mortal by deſert, and venial or pardonable only by Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. 3. There is no third place, beſide Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Hell; therefore there is no Purgatory for Venial Sins. 4. No Man can, or ſhall ſuffer more than he deſerveth, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 130.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10.</p>

The Covenant of Life, or Works, or Nature being broken, God did not renew that, but made another, called the Covenant of Grace, becauſe it proceeds from Grace, after a Breach; and promiſeth Grace to keep it, in the conſtruction of Grace or Goſpel ſence.

                  <head>By a Redeemer.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is our Redeemer from guilt and juſtice by a Ranſom and Price: from our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Satan, the World and Sin by Power. He is our Lord becauſe of his Right and Power to govern and redeem us. He is <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which is as much as Saviour; <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is as much as <hi>Meſſiah</hi> or Anointed, to be Mediator, Prophet, Prieſt and King.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His Perſon is Wonderful. He is <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> God with us, God-Man. He was the eternal Son of God before he was the Son of God by the <hi>Virgin Mary.</hi> He had a Being, and a Glory before he was Man. See, <hi>John</hi> 17.5. Where note, 1. Who Pray'd; he did not pray, as he was God: for God wants nothing, and hath nothing to ask. 2. Nor only as he was Man, for as Man he had no Glory with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before the World began. 3. He pray'd as he was mediator, a Prieſt by Office. 4. As Prieſt, it was his duty and office to pray; and he pray'd to God as Father, for himſelf as Son, now in both Natures. 2. Note what he pray'd
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93290:69"/> for. Wherein obſerve, 1. He had a glory with the Father before the World was. 2. That glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was the glory of a Son, <hi>v.</hi> 2. Glorify thy Son. 3. He had that glory of a Son, before he was Man, for he was not Man before the World was. 4. He was with the Father as a Son from eternity, begotten in a manner unconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, therefore we ſay, he was the eternal Son of God. 5. The glory of a Son was not loſt, but darkned by his taking our Nature, and the form of a Servant. Now then, he Pray'd for this, that his humane Nature now united to him might partake of the glory, which he had as a Son, and that his Sonly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry might ſhine forth. This glory of a Son was his eſſential glory, poſſeſs'd with the Father, and not a glory to which he was predeſtinated, as the Adverſaries pretend, who quote 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. But mark, <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, The glory which I had with thee before the World was. He had it, the Elect had it not before they had a Being: they were predeſtinated to it in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as their decreed Head, and Saviour, who poſſeſs'd it before all time, in his own Perſon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Eternal Son of God became Man: How? not by ceaſing to be what he was before; but by taking to him that humane Nature, which he had not before, into Perſonal Union: See, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. He was in Being before he was made Fleſh, and what he was, before he was made Fleſh, we read, <hi>ver.</hi> 1,2,3. 1. He was God. 2. He made all things, therefore was not made himſelf. 3. He was in the beginning
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93290:69"/> of time; he did not then begin to be; but was before that beginning was, in which all things were made by him. He muſt needs be, and be able to make all things, before they were made by him. Now this is He, who was made Fleſh, or took our Nature. They who deny his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal God-head, ſay, 1. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is called the Word, or Speech of God, becauſe God ſpake by him. 2. They will not have our tranſlation ſtand, <hi>was made,</hi> but <hi>Was.</hi> 3. Was Fleſh, that is the ſpeech of God, was Fleſh; that is, he was frail, ſubject to infirmities, and ſorrows. But beſide the abſurdity of their ſence, which comes to this, The ſpeech was frail, that is, the Man, who was the ſpeech of God, was a frail Man, there are two things ſtrongly for our ſence. 1. What ever is ſpoken of the word, which was made Fleſh, or became Man, is very glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. 2. If their corrupt meaning were true, it would better agree; <hi>And we ſaw his frailty and Sorows,</hi> than what follows, <hi>And we ſaw his Glory, as the only begotten Son of God:</hi> even under the Cloud and Veil of his humane Nature, we beheld more than Man, or Creature, even the Glory of the only begotten Son of God, full of grace and truth.</p>
                  <p>To be ſhort: Let us believe, 1. He who took our Nature was the only begotten Son of God, not ſo called, only becauſe more beloved than all other Children, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was. 2. He took humane Nature to Union with his own Divine eternal Perſon, and not a humane Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. 3. The Divine and humane Nature in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93290:70"/> the Perſon of the Son, are diſtinct, and not mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or confounded. 4. Becauſe he is but one Perſon, the properties of each Nature are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Perſon, by what Divines call, the Communication of Properties, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. 5. The humane Nature is not Omniſcient, nor Omnipreſent as the Divine nature is. 6. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is mediator according to both natures. The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator is God and Man in one Perſon; therefore, and all the parts of the mediatory office, being performed by the mediator, he doth all things, according to both natures, becauſe he is called the Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. Therefore ſome ſay, he is but a Man, others ſay he is Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor only as he is Man.

                  <p n="2">2. He took a true Body, and reaſonable Soul, compleat humane Nature. 1. A Body, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5. The words inform us of a Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and the Son as two diſtinct Perſons, and what each one was to do. As the Father was in Being before this Body was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared; ſo was the Son before he came to do his Will, in that Body, and ſo was the Holy Ghoſt, by whom this Body was conceived.

                  <p n="3">3. This Body was a true Body, not a phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſm, or a Celeſtial Body, paſſing through the Body of the Virgin, like lightning through the Air, or Water through a Chanel, but a ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial humane Body, with Fleſh and Blood, for Sacrifice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.39.</p>

That which is conceived in Her, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.20. He was made of a Woman, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. The Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Holy Ghoſt was not upon the Divine Nature, or Perſon of the Son, but altogether upon the <hi>Virgins Womb,</hi> cauſing her to conceive a true ſubſtantial Body, with a Soul created in it, and both prepared for Union with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Perſon, who took the humane Nature, ſo Conceived, into perſonal Union with himſelf. That which this nature received from the Son, was perſonality, or to be one Perſon with him. The Holy Virgin was active and paſſive in this Conception. <hi>Thou ſhalt Conceive in thy Womb,</hi> &amp;c, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.31. and that which is Conceived in her is of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.20.</p>

               <p n="2">2. This great Prophet teacheth outwardly by his word, and Miniſters, and inwardly by his Spirit, and this is effectual to Salvation. <hi>Chriſt</hi> both preached and gave repentance, which is Gods prerogative: See, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.26. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. He at once opened the Heart, and the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.32,45.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt</hi> as Mediator doth act in ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Father, yet not as if he were but Man only, inſtructed by God, and to that end ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up to Heaven in the ſpace of the forty days temptation, to receive Revelations from him; nor as if he were but God only by deputation, as they ſay. He is a Prophet as God-Man, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.18. The only begotten Son hath declared him. Even while he was upon Earth, as Man, he was in the Boſom of the Father, as God, as one eſſentially with him, and intimate in all his thoughts.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>CHriſt</hi> is truly and properly a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and not Metaphorically, as if he only did ſomething like a <hi>Prieſt.</hi> He anſwers the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> made <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.3. more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>chap.</hi> 5.1. We have him deſcribed in the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Perſon to be a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> as holy, harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, &amp;c, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. by the order of his <hi>Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, Heb.</hi> 6.20. and by his call to his Office, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4,5,6. He had a true real Sacrifice to Offer for Men, for the Sins of Men, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.3. He offer'd himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. <hi>chap.</hi> 9.14. <hi>chap.</hi> 10.12. <hi>chap.</hi> 9.26. and entred into the Holy place of Heaven to make Interceſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. He excelled all legal <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and is as truly a <hi>Prieſt</hi> as ever any <hi>Prieſt</hi> was.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Sacrifice which he offered, was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al proper Sacrifice: See again, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.2. This Text is groſsly perverted to this ſence, That the help and kindneſs ſhewed to Men by the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was as pleaſing to God, as if it had been a Sacrifice acceptable to him. But in the words obſerve, 1. <hi>Chriſt</hi> had power to diſpoſe of himſelf, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93290:74"/> he gave himſelf: there was neither violence, nor injury done him. His Death was violent from Men, but voluntary of himſelf. Not <hi>my</hi> will, but <hi>thy</hi> will be done. 2. He gave himſelf for us; as the <hi>Beaſts</hi> were ſacrificed for Men, for their Sin, under the Law. 3. The nature of his Gift; he gave himſelf a Sacrifice and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to God. 4. He gave himſelf an Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and Sacrifice to God, who required it. 5. He gave himſelf for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.21. <hi>Levit.</hi> 1.9. It was offered to make atonement, and God was ſatisfied, and well pleaſed with it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Excellency, Eſſicacy and All-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of his Blood, his Life, his Death, as a Sacrifice appears, 1. It was but one Sacrifice for Sins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.12. 2. It was offer'd but once, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.25,26,28. This offering, was ſuffering, thereby to put away Sin, in its Guilt and Obligation to Puniſhment, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The end of this Sacrifice, was, 1. To ſatisfy Divine juſtice, and, 2. To reconcile us to God. To explain, and prove this, conſider, 1. God is eſſentially Holy and Juſt; he hateth Sin, and Sin deſerveth it: See, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 11.7. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 45.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.31. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.6. It is a righteous thing with God, &amp;c. 2. As God may make a Law, ſo he may threaten to puniſh, and puniſh according to his threatning and righteous Law. 3. God did both, and Man ſinned, and by Sin became li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to puniſhment. 4. Such was the Wiſdom of God, in making a poſitive Law, which might be relaxed, and the puniſhment transferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93290:74"/> another, who might ſatisfy by bearing the puniſhment. 5. Yet God ſtood upon this, that his eſſential and governing Juſtice ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisſied, and that the Satisfier ſhould die. So it was agreed, in the Covenant of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, between the Father and the Son, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 53.10. See the place. What God required, the Mediator performed. Mark, 1. The Guilty Sinner could not ſatisfy by ſuffering Death. 2. The Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator muſt be God-Man, that he might ſuffer, ſatisfy, merit, and ſave the Sinner. 3. <hi>Chriſt</hi> did voluntarily engage as a ſurety to die and ſatisfy. 4. The Death he ſuffered was the puniſhment of Sin, the curſe of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. 5. He was made a Curſe for us, in our ſtead and for our good, to redeem us that were under the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. 6. God had reſpect to his juſtice in the Blood of his Son, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25,26. that he might be juſt. 7. This Blood and Death was the Price of our Redemption, which was ſufficient, and a ſatisfaction; it was given to God, and accepted of him, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.2. 8. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſit follows, which is Redemption in a proper ſence, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. And there are two great proofs of this perfect ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. 1. Becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> roſe from the Dead. 2. They who believe in him are juſtified. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25,26.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other end of <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Prieſthood</hi> and Sacrifice was to reconcile us to God. <hi>Christ</hi> died to atone, or appeaſe the Holy, and juſt indignation of God. His Blood is the propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for our Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. and when we
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93290:75"/> were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the Death of his Son, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. He is the propitiatory Sacrifice for Sin, and propitiation was the effect of it. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. The propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory, or Mercy-Seat in the <hi>Temple</hi> did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile Sinners to God, but it was a type of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the true propitiatory, and a ſign that God was reconciled, and propitious or gracious: but <hi>Chriſt</hi> did reconcile Sinners by his Death, as he intended, <hi>Hee.</hi> 2.17. and God hath ſo ſet him forth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. and declares himſelf to be truly and properly reconciled.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We are actually reconciled to God, when we believe in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and are converted: but our converſion is not our reconciliation. <hi>Chriſt</hi> by making atonement, made way for our converſion, and reception upon repentance. The reconciling of Sinners is the Work of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> the converſion of Sinners is the Work of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>There are two parts of the Prieſtly, office of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> 1. Satisfaction by Sacrifice. 2. Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion upon ſatisfaction or Redemption. His Interceſſion is a part, and but a part of his <hi>Prieſthood, Heb.</hi> 7.25. He had a Body and Soul for Sacrifice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.9,10. He offered himſelf upon Earth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12,14. and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged away Sin by expiation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>chap.</hi> 10,12. His Death was a Sacrifice for Sins, and not a preparation for Sacrifice, or a way to his Reſurrection. The ſuffering part he finiſhed upon Earth; and began his Interceſſion upon Earth, <hi>John</hi> 17. and at other times, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93290:75"/> it in Heaven; and his Interceſſion doth preſuppoſe his propitiation, 1 <hi>Joh</hi> 2.1,2. The reaſon why he could not be a <hi>Prieſt</hi> upon Earth, was not becauſe he was not properly a <hi>Prieſt</hi> or had no Sacrifice upon Earth to offer, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was not of the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> but of <hi>Melchiſedeck, Heb.</hi> 8.4.</p>

                     </gap>,</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and Satisfaction of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it follows, 1. The Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſs</hi> is falſe and ſinful; for, 1.

He was offer'd once and to be offered no more, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12. <hi>ver.</hi> 28 <hi>chap.</hi> 10,12,13,14. 3. The Sacrifice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was Bloody; without Blood there is no remiſſion of ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. there is no Blood-ſhed in the <hi>Maſs,</hi> therefore no remiſſion of ſin by it. 4. To Sacrifice <hi>Chriſt</hi> is all one as to kill him, and put him to ſuffer, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is in not the hands of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> to be kill'd. 5. <hi>Christ</hi> profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth none but the living through Faith, the <hi>Maſs</hi> is for the Living and Dead but to what purpoſe?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſatisfaction of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is perfect, his ſufferings are meritorious; there is therefore no place, uſe, or need of humane ſatisfactions, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24.</p>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93290:76"/> as mediator. He hath Royal Titles, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.16. He hath Kingly power, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 2.7,8,9. and a Kingdom, <hi>yea Kingdoms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto him, Rev.</hi> 17.14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His Kingly power is univerſal, made Heir of all things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. but not of this World, like earthly Rings, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.36.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He was decreed, and foretold to be King before he was born, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 110.1,2,3. and was born King, <hi>Luke.</hi> 1.31,32,33.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He actually exerciſed his Kingly Power before, but not ſo gloriouſly and fully, as after his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, <hi>John</hi> 17.1,2. for he wrought Miracles, raiſed the Dead, caſt out Devils, and gave power to his Diſciples to do ſo. Therefore it is not true, that he was not King before his Aſcenſion, and that his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Aſcenſion were only preparatory to his Kingly Office.</p>
               <p n="5">5. His Kingly Power is exerciſed towards his People: 1. In ſubduing and converting them, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 110.3. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.26. <hi>chap.</hi> 5.31. <hi>chap.</hi> 26.18. 2. In governing them being ſubdued, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.8,9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.20. 3. In ſuccouring them when tempted, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.10. 4. In keeping them to ſalvation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>John</hi> 10.28. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 32.1,2. Towards his enemies, as he pleaſeth he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains them, breaks them, and will overcome them, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 2.9,10. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 110.1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.25. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.20. And he ſhall judge the World, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9,10,11. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10,11.</p>
               <p>Hence it followeth, that it is ſinful arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and uſurpation to pretend to be Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal

No more was raiſed up, than what was buried; namely, his Body; yet, as the whole Man is ſaid to riſe, or to be raiſed from the Dead, when only the Body is raiſed, ſo it is ſaid of Chriſt, 1 Cor. 15.20. <hi>Chriſt the firſt fruits of them that ſlept.</hi> V. 23. —<hi>Afterwards they that are Chriſt's.</hi> V. 35. <hi>And with what bodies do they come.</hi> Acts 24.15. <hi>There ſhall be a Reſurrection of the juſt and unjuſt; i.e.</hi> of juſt and unjuſt Perſons, and not Bodies only: So Chriſt is ſaid to riſe, when his Body only was raiſed. 3. By what Power Chriſt roſe, or was raiſed. There is a Concurrence of the three Perſons, in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt: 1. The Father, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.11. 2. Of the Holy Ghoſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18,19.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93290:78"/> 
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. 3. Of his own Power, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.18. The Power is the ſame Power of God. The Reſurrection of Chriſt is ſpoken of, actively attributed to the Father, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.24. and to his own Power, as his own Act, Joh. 2.19. —<hi>I will raiſe it up.</hi> What the Father did, he did; the Father's Power and his being all one and the ſame, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing one and the ſame individual Effect. It is alſo ſpoken of paſſively; Chriſt was raiſed from the Dead: —<hi>I will raiſe it up,</hi> Joh. 2.19. is more than to ſay, <hi>I ſhall riſe again;</hi> and more than was ever ſpoken of, or by any Believer. That place, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.33. ſpeaks not of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, but of the Way to be ſaved eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and of the Encouragement to ſuffer Death for Chriſt. On <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18. conſider, 1. Chriſt, as Mediator, received Commandment from the Father, which none could execute but he who was God. 2. The Command given did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe Power in himſelf to execute it. None but God can raiſe the Dead; and it is more to raiſe himſelf, than to raiſe another. Thoſe Men who raiſed the Dead by the miraculous Power of God, did not raiſe their own Bodies; but Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I will raiſe it up,</hi> and <hi>I have Power.</hi> 3. Every true Believer may ſay, <hi>When I am dead, I ſhall be raiſed up:</hi> But none can ſay, <hi>I will raiſe it up.</hi> The Temple of Chriſt's Body could not raiſe it ſelf, the Soul could not raiſe it; but there was a Will and Power in Chriſt, proper to God; not lent him for that Act and Time only, but eſſential and proper; <hi>I will raiſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93290:78"/> it up,</hi> and <hi>I have power to take it up.</hi> To make a difference between <hi>Excitabo,</hi> and <hi>Erigam,</hi> and the meaning to be, <hi>Chriſt being excited from the Dead, did erect his own Body,</hi> is, to make an hard ſhift to deny the Divine Power of Chriſt. What though it be ſaid, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. <hi>He was quickned by the Spirit;</hi> and not, <hi>by his own Spirit;</hi> as long as the Spirit of God is called the Spirit of Chriſt? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9,11.</p>
                  <p>To make the Reſurrection, Aſcenſion and Seſſion of Chriſt at the Right Hand, to be only in order to his governing and defending the Faithful, and only to belong to his Kingly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, is to ſpeak ſhort of Scripture: For, 1. He was declared to be the Son of God, by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the Dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. 2. He aroſe for our Juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, and his Satisfaction accepted. 3.

                  <p n="2">2. The Ends and Reaſons of it are, 1. That he might be glorified in his Humane Nature, as

                  <p>Hence it appears, 1. He aſcended not into Heaven only for his own perſonal Glory, or for the Government of the Faithful, or becauſe it was the place of Immortality, and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Saints.</p>
                  <p>2. His glorified Body is not in all places, but in Heaven, from whence we look for him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1,4.</p>

The Ranſom was paid, therefore it was accepted and received; the Effect and Benefit followed, therefore it was received; and God was the Receiver. And it is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to ſay, That the Son of God, the Second Perſon, as an offended God, was ſatisfied by himſelf, as he was Mediator.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Redemption muſt be applied to us, and then we reap the Benefit of it actually, when it is applied effectually.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the Benefit of it was intended for us, to bring us to God, and make us one, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.20,21.</p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:93290:80"/>
                  <p n="4">4. When we believe it is effectually applied, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.15,16,18. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This Application is peculiarly aſcribed to the Holy Spirit, not excluding the Father, and the Son; ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.25. There is an Order of Working obſerved in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Trinity: After Chriſt's leaving the World, the Holy Ghoſt was to take the Adminiſtration of Chriſt's Kingdom, by Agreement; as ſeems clear from <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.7,14,15,16. <hi>He ſhall give of mine to you,</hi> by Application of it to their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The way of this Application is, by Union with Chriſt, by which we are inveſted in his Benefits, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.12.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Nothing can be more real than this Union: See, I pray, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21,23. <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.20. And the real Benefit follows, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27.

                  <p n="2">2. The Terms of this Union are Perſons, <hi>You in me, and I in you.</hi> An Union of Qualities, and not of Perſons, is as irrational, as Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents without Subjects.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We are not united to Chriſt by means of our Union, as particular Members with the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Church; for Chriſt, the Head and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, is the immediate Object of our Faith; therefore by Faith we are immediately united
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93290:81"/> to Chriſt, and that in Order of Nature, before we are united to the Church, though at the ſame time: And Chriſt is to every true Believer, what he is to the whole Church of Believers; an Head of Influence, a Vine, a Shepherd, an Husband.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Faith is the Means, Grace, or Bond of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion on our parts: By Faith we receive Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. live by him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. and feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.47,48. <hi>Ver.</hi> 35.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Spirit of God is the Author of this Union, and Faith is called the Spirit of Faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13. as well as of Regeneration and Sanctification, wherein Faith is a principal Grace.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We call this a myſtical Union, in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a natural and viſible Union: It is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, illuſtrated by natural, artificial and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Union, in metaphorical Shadows and Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations. We do not darken or deceive the Minds of Men, by calling this Union Myſtical, or Secret: The whole of our Religion, and, in particular, this Union is a Myſtery, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.32. and therefore to expoſe this Term, <hi>Myſtical,</hi> to deriſion, is to reflect upon the Goſpel, and our Chriſtianity, and calls for Repentance.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. A political Union is an Union of Perſons in Policy or Government, and is too narrow and low to expreſs this Union; for we are united to Chriſt as a Saviour, and receive Benefits from him in all his Offices, and not only as King.</p>

               <head>SECT. XIX. Of Effectual Calling.</head>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <p n="1">1. EFfectual Calling is the ſame Work of Grace, as Regeneration, or Converſion. When God calls inwardly by his Spirit, as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by his Word, this Call is effectual, or attains its proper Effect, to bring a Sinner to God. This Work is ſet out by <hi>Calling,</hi> becauſe by it we are brought hom, who are far from God by Nature; not in Place, but Affection and Condition. When Faith anſwers, and we ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, ſaying, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Act. 9.6. we are called and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Election and Vocation are not all one: The Elect, and Called, are the ſame Perſons: Vocation is the Execution of the Decree of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which is the Cauſe, or neceſſary Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of it, and is known by it. In Vocation, Electing Love takes hold of the Sinner, to bring him out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> or <hi>Egypt,</hi> or ſpiritual Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, into Light and Liberty: The one is from Eternity, the other in Time; the one is in God, the other the Work of God upon the Sinner.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They who love God, are called; but it is not true that they love God before they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; for then the Anſwer would be before the Call. If they do not love God before they are called, they do not love God before they are elected; ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. where note, 1. God
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93290:82"/> doth purpoſe. 2. He calls according to Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. 3. They who love God, are called; and called to love God, and not becauſe they love God: See the Order amplified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.</hi> 1.4,5. Election and Predeſtination are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Vocation: If our Love to God be the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Motive of God's electing us, then we love God firſt, contrary to 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.19.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They wrong the Teachers of the Truth, who ſay, we deny Free Will, whereas we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert it to be as eſſential to Man, as Reaſon is, and that Free Will continues in every ſtate; in Innocency, Corruption, Renovation and Glory. Sinful Man is a moral, free Agent; he doth act according to his Imaginations, Propenſions and Luſts: He doth freely ſerve Sin, and is free from Righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.20. When he is made free from Sin, by renewing Grace, he acts as a new Man, freely towards God, but with much oppoſition from in-dwelling Sin. As the Man is, ſo is his Will: An unregenerate Man is unwilling, averſe and perverſe, impotent and dead one way, that is, to God's Will, and bent another. If gracious Motions and Actions are contrary to ſinful in the Regenerate, they are contrary to, and above the performauce of the Unregenerate. As every degree of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Light is from above, ſo every degree of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to Good is given of God. If ſpiritual Objects are not known, nor perceived, but by Revelation of the things, and Illumination of the Mind, they are not willed, but by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Will.</p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:93290:82"/>
                  <p n="5">5. The <hi>Socinians</hi> (I name them for all of the ſame mind) deny Original Sin altogether, and therefore aſſert, A Man may, of himſelf, believe and obey, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To clear the Truth (beſides what hath been ſaid for Original Sin,) 1. To deny Original Sin, is, in effect, to deny Actual. 2. To aſſert Freedom of Will as they do, is, to fanſie Man as able now, as before the Fall? If we are not fallen into a ſtate of Sin, we have no need of a Redeemer, nor Faith in him; but we are taught the need of Redemption and Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration both. 3. There is no force nor vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence done to the Will of Man, when God calls and draws him to himſelf by Chriſt. 4. What probity or aptneſs was in <hi>Paul,</hi> a Blaſphemer; or in the <hi>Jews,</hi> before pricked in their hearts; or in the Gaoler, or in any <hi>Gentile,</hi> to turn to God; or for which God turned them, and not others? What probity, or aptneſs, or inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards Converſion was in them, who counted the preaching of Chriſt Fooliſhneſs? 5. Expound that Text, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.48. by probi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Mind, or aptneſs; then the meaning of the place muſt needs be this, <hi>As many as were apt to Eternal Life, believed;</hi> and ſo they were apt to Eternal Life, before they believed. Were they apt before their Eyes were opened, before their Hearts were turned, or the Goſpel preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? But admit they were not the blind Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, but Proſelytes, who left their Heatheniſm, and Uncircumciſion, that are ſpoken of; how came they to be apt to believe, whenas many <hi>Jews</hi> remained Unbelievers? The truth is,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93290:83"/> 1. All Preparations and Aptneſs towards God, is not from our Free Will (which ſtands off) but Grace. God and our ſelves are oppoſed, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8. If from our ſelves, not from God; if of God, not from our ſelves. The firſt beginning of a good Work in us, is from Grace, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. the firſt Will, and firſt Motion is God's Work, and not our own, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. Where was this Probity and Aptneſs in them who ſay, they were fooliſh, diſobedient? <hi>&amp;c. Tit.</hi> 3.3. and Idolaters? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9,10. 3. Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Calling is from one contrary point, and ſtate to another, from Darkneſs to Light, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.8. from Idols, to the living God, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.9. from Satan, to God, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. from Death, to Life, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1,5 from ſerving Sin, to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17, <hi>to</hi> 22. What is in Man's Will and Nature towards God and Holineſs, but what is not of our ſelves?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. This heavenly Calling is drawing, <hi>Joh</hi> 6.44. which we profeſs, as well as they, to be without force or violence: And they who are drawn, are taught of God. But then, we ſay, 1. There is, beſides the propoſal of exceeding great and precious Promiſes, an inward Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Holy Ghoſt; and they only who are ſo taught, are drawn powerfully and ſweetly to Chriſt. 2. This effectual Teaching and Drawing is not common to all, for then all would believe and come. Chriſt, as liſted up, is a drawing Object, that hath enough in him to draw all Men to him; yet all, and every Man come not. We muſt, from the Event, expound the words,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93290:83"/> 
                     <hi>All Men, Joh.</hi> 12.32. with limitation unto all ſorts, degrees, and Nations, and not of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals and particular Men: even as <hi>Paul</hi> was to be a Witneſs to <hi>All Men, Acts</hi> 22.15. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.19. i.e. many.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. In vain do Men ſpeak of a good Life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Regeneration or Faith in <hi>Christ:</hi> and Goſpel Aſſiſtances are not ſufficient without the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual operation of the ſpirit. Aſſiſtances do only ſuppoſe infirmity in us: and they who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate are ſubject to weakneſs: but unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate are worſe, than impotent or weak: and weak believers have inward Life, as well as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward aſſiſtances, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.4. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. Therefore outward means are not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to un regenerate dead Sinners.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The work of effectual calling doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us what we are by nature before it: we are Ignorant, Averſe, Dead, Rebellious. <hi>A new Heart will I give you:</hi> not a new faculty, but, <hi>a Will made free from its Love to evil and Enmity to good.</hi> God effectually perſwades, and alſo ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles us to believe in <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
               </div>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <head>The effectually called are justified.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. To juſtify is all one as in Engliſh, to make juſt; but in this point, it is to be taken, as in a courſe of Law, to abſolve, acquit, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, to repute a Man as juſt who is guilty, ſubject to accuſation, and condemnation.</p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:93290:84"/>
                  <p n="2">2. We agree, that in this gracious act, God doth acquit the believer (who is penitent) alſo from deſerved condemnation, and doth put him into the condition of a Righteous Perſon.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is a concurrence of free grace, and ſatisfaction, and redemption in this act: See, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. God's love and <hi>Chriſts</hi> Death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He that is juſtified is accepted, and look'd upon as Righteous in the ſight of God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. God juſtifieth as both gracious and juſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. with <hi>ver.</hi> 26. the Sinner is in himſelf unrighteous: the righteous God looks for a perfect Righteouſneſs; the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Christ</hi> is moſt perfect, called the Righteouſneſs of God by Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22. and the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of one, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17,18. With this alone, the juſt God is ſatisfied, who doth graciouſly impute, or reckon it to every one who believeth: by faith we are inveſted in it, and entituled to it by Gods free gift.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The juſt God ſet forth <hi>Chriſt</hi> a propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or atonement by the Sacrifice of himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. With this God was ſatisfied; and it being intended for him that believes, it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to him, and he receives and applies it for his juſtification.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Perſon being untighteous, and guilty, is not juſtified, as an innocent Righteous Perſon in himſelf: but for <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſake He doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and confeſs his iniquity and guilt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.9. and is taught to plead, as we ſee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33,34.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93290:84"/> He is taught to ſhew cauſe, why he is not condemned.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It is the nature of Faith in general, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to, and correſpond with the gracious Acts of God: ſo it doth in Juſtification. Here's a gift of Righteouſneſs, and Faith humbly receiveth it: and becauſe that perfect Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is that by which a guilty offender is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. and faith alone doth receive, appropriate, and apply it, therefore we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by faith alone, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22,25,26,28.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 I humbly conceive, Faith is not imputed for Righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. as that which is accepted inſtead of a perfect perſonal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: thus if we have faith it ſhall ſerve, and be taken, where perfect Righteouſneſs is not to be had: For, 1. The Perſon juſtified, is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unrighteous and guilty, and God doth not juſtify him for that which is taken inſtead of Perſonal Righteouſneſs, for then God would ſeem to have reſpect to a Mans own Perſonal Righteouſneſs, in defect of which he takes what may be had. 2. Becauſe God looks upon our Mediator, as Obeying, Dying, Satisfying, and not upon us, who are unable to ſatisfy: See, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22,24,25,26. 3. Becauſe our Faith is not to be taken ſeparately from its object, <hi>Chriſt.</hi> It was not looking, but looking on the Serpent, that healed; ſo it is believing in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that juſtifies, and ſaves, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14,16. Faith without works is imputed, but not without <hi>Christ.</hi> I do not ſay, that Faith is imputed, as taken for its object, i. e. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is imputed; nor
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93290:85"/> that faith is imputed, as taken in lieu of Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Righteouſneſs, but Faith with its object, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is imputed, for Faith cannot be ſeparated from him, its object: for the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are required to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, the one with, and not without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Not to impute Sin, is not to reckon it to condemnation, and it is not ſo reckoned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Christ</hi> died: and when it is not imputed to condemnation, it is pardoned, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. They who ſay, we are juſtified by Faith, as a condition, and are not <hi>Socinians,</hi> do mean ſoundly, and no more, but that Faith is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to juſtification, and to aſcribe as little as may be, to Faith, and as much as may be to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> To ſay that Faith is a condition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, a Man is not juſtified, is to ſpeak too little, becauſe it is poſitively required, not as that without which, but as that by which a Man is juſtified. And they who ſay, as the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reformers ſpake, we are juſtified by Faith, as by an inſtrument, produce warrant from the Scripture, make up the number of Cauſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, and aſcribe, but the loweſt degree of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality to Faith; both agree in the main Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and differ in manner of Explication.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. He who is juſtified by Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is alſo juſtified by Works. The Perſon ſpoken of by <hi>Paul,</hi> is a guilty unrighteous Sinner, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. The Perſon ſpoken of by <hi>James,</hi> is a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal profeſſor, who ſaith he hath Faith, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.14. He hath no true Faith who hath not
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93290:85"/> Works to his Faith, and therefore cannot be juſtified.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. The way of juſtification, even before <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was by Faith in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21,22.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. No Man is actually juſtified, before he doth believe. The believer was intentionally juſtified from eternity; in decree, meritoriouſly from the Death of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. A Juſtified Perſon is taught to pray for pardon, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.12. and to confeſs his Sin, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9.</p>

                  <head>Are Adopted.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. To adopt is to make, or take one for a <hi>Child,</hi> who by Nature is not a <hi>Child,</hi> and he hath the Name, State, Dignity and privileges of a <hi>Child.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Adoption is an Act of Grace, and if that which follows our effectual Calling, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification be an Act of grace, then ſurely Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Juſtification, muſt be by Grace?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Adoption is the foundation of our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirſhip with <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

They are bound to keep by the equity of that other part of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, who brought thee out, &amp;c. A redeemed Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt ſerve their Redeemer. 3.

               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="3">3. The Law is as it alwaies was, a perfect Law; therefore our Saviour did not as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, add new precepts to it.

                     <p n="2">2. The Socinians prove, that Divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is due to Chriſt, from <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.5. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.25. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.59,60. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12 7,8. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.11 That the firſt Commandment is not changed, by giving him ſuch honour; for he is no ſtrange, but a ſubordinate God. From this Conceſſion of theirs, I argue for his Glory, againſt their falſe Opinion of Chriſt. 1. He who ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other God but me,</hi> ſaith of himſelf, <hi>I am Jehovah, thy God.</hi> We muſt have none for God, but he who is <hi>Jehovah: Thou ſhalt have no other God but me;</hi> or, <hi>before me.</hi> Therefore, if Chriſt ought to be worſhipped by this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment (as they confeſs,) he is God <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the only true God. He ought to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with divine Honour, by virtue of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment: But there is no God to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, according to this Commandment, but <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah, thy God;</hi> therefore he is <hi>Jehovah.</hi> 2. There is no ſubordinate <hi>Jehovah:</hi> Chriſt is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> therefore not a ſubordinate God. 3. A ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate God, is a ſtrange God: <hi>Any God but me,</hi> is a ſtrange God; therefore any God but <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi> is a ſtrange God; for <hi>Me</hi> is a Relative to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93290:91"/> 
                        <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and <hi>Me</hi> is the ſame as God <hi>Jehovah.</hi> 4. The Object of our Worſhip in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is but one <hi>Jehovah, thy God:</hi> If Chriſt be not that one <hi>Jehovah,</hi> he is not at all to be worſhipped, by this Commandment; but he is to be worſhipped as God, therefore he is <hi>Jehovah.</hi> 5. There is but one Cauſe of our Salvation, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.3,4. <hi>chap.</hi> 2.13. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.3. <hi>chap.</hi> 4.10. therefore it cannot be, that Chriſt is honoured as God, by the firſt Commandment, becauſe he is the ſecond Cauſe of our Salvation. 6. If Chriſt be not God <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and yet ought to be worſhipped with divine Honour, the Commandment muſt needs be changed; for if there be a new Object of Worſhip, there is a Change of the Commandment.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Worſhip of God is kept pure, when it is not depraved with mixtures of falſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with the true; it is entire, when the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances are not more, nor fewer than Chriſt hath enjoined; nor any part taken from, nor added to them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When God is worſhipped with the Heart, he is worſhipped in Spirit, and when he is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped plainly, without Types and Shadows, he is worſhipped in Truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.24.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The outward manner of God's Worſhip muſt be ſuitable to God, and to the general Rules of his Word. A Form of Words is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in ſome parts of Worſhip, and is but a manner, or mode of doing, and corrupteth not the Subſtance.

                  <p n="3">3. The Cup of bleſſing belongs as much to every Communicant as the Bread: Our Saviour, and his Miniſters gave both, and Communicants received both. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.26. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25,26.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe I ſhall lay down ſeveral truths contrary to ſo many errors.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is a diſtinction between Miniſters and Stewards, and the family of Believers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. As <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did, ſo Miniſters and Stewards take Bread and Wine, bleſs, break, give, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. —<hi>which we bleſs,</hi> &amp;c. The Communicating believers do join with the Paſtor in prayer and thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and then they take, and eat, and drink, and that is all they ought to do. Except the Bread and Wine are Conſecrated to that end, according to our Saviours inſtitution, it is no Sacrament. It is not true therefore, that the Lords Supper was inſtituted that the Faithful might break the Bread.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In ſhewing the Lords Death we ſhew, 1.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93290:97"/> The nature and end of his death, as a Sacrifice to God for ſin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24,25. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.28. <hi>Mark</hi> 14.24. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19,20. 2. The painfulneſs of his death. 3. The All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency, ſatisfaction and merit of it. 4. We humbly ſhew it by Faith to God, as a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and price of Redemption, and plead it, and reſt upon it. 5. We ſhew it againſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations of Conſcience, and all other from Satan, and the World. 6. We ſhew it to all the Churches as one Body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſhew the Lords Death is more, than to thank <hi>Chriſt</hi> for his love, and to celebrate the good turn of his ſuffering with praiſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The reſurrection, aſcenſion, and interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are his own mediatory actions; therefore, that is no good reaſon why <hi>Chriſt</hi> ordained this remembrance of his death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the chief, or moſt properly his own action.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We receive Covenant Bleſſings, as well as give thanks at his Supper, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Aſſurance of pardon is not neceſſary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we eat and drink this Supper, it is a help to aſſurance, but it is a feaſt for the weakeſt believers that thirſt, that diſcern the Lords Body and examine themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. This, in the words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> doth not comprehend all the Sacramental actions; each of which hath its particular edifying, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing ſignification.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We do not only partake of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, but have Communion with his Body, and Blood, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16.</p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:93290:98"/>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>To bleſs</hi> is ill expounded <hi>to uſe it.</hi> To uſe the Cup is not a Sacramental, Scripture Phraſe. To bleſs it according to the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Saviour, is peculiar to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; the congregation joining with him, and beholding the Sacramental actions, and hearing the words, <hi>This is my Body, Take eat, This do,</hi> &amp;c. In thoſe congregations, where the houſhold of God, do not receive every one from the hand of the Miniſter, but take themſelves, the whole is firſt bleſt, broken, poured out, and the words of inſtitution and command repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; or it is no Sacrament, as was ſaid before: See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24. All do uſe it, as they ſay; but all do not bleſs it.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. True believers have ſpiritual, real, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, and comforting Communion by Faith, with the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and not a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative. Benefits flow from Communion: See again, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16.</p>

               <head>SECT. XXVI. Of the Lords Prayer.</head>
               <p n="1">1. TAke both Evangeliſts <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> together, and it appears that this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is both a form of prayer, and a pattern for prayer; and yet it is rather a form of matter, than of words, ſeeing both thoſe Holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do not keep to the ſame words. And why it may not be uſed as a prayer, as well as <hi>the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Love of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:93290:98"/> God the Father, and the Communion of the Holy be with you,</hi> let them who uſe the one, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe the other, conſider of it: yea much rather, becauſe there is not ſo much, as pray or bleſs the Aſſembly, after this manner ſaid of that ſolemn form of diſmiſſion, which is ſaid of this prayer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The matter, and method of it is Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, and deſerves our ſtudy that it may be underſtood. We are taught how to conceive of God, as a Glorious Father; that his glory ſhould be our aim above all things; how we ſhould be affected towards him and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; how our Wills ſhould come in to his Will, concurr with it, and ſubmit to it in all things; we are taught how ſmall a portion of the World ſhould content us, how we ſhould acknowledge him to be the giver of all; to have our dependance upon him, and to have daily recourſe to him by prayer. We are taught to confeſs our ſins to him and be earneſt for pardon, and to what degree of grace we ſhould grow even to forgive, and love our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. We are inform'd of our greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and evils, and to pray for deliverance from evil, and temptations to evil, and how we ſhould praiſe and magnify him, as glorious in our eyes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We are not tied to the very words and ſyllables of it, as is before intimated; yet it is as ſtrange that it is not uſed at all by ſome, as that it ſhould be the only prayer in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of others.</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:93290:99"/>
               <p n="4">4. We do not conclude our other prayers with this, as if this made our other prayers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable; we are heard for our faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſincerity of our hearts, and not for theſe words.</p>
               <p n="5">5. All our petitions are ultimately referr'd to the glory of God, our higheſt end, in the firſt petition.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Great care ſhould be taken, that all our prayers both private, and publick do agree with this holy rule of prayer. All <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould conſpire, to pray the ſame things, and be alwaies diſpoſed to maintain Communion with God, and with all his People, as Brethren and Children of the ſame Heavenly Father.</p>
               <p n="7">7. We ſhould ſo pray, as being in earneſt, and maintain our fervency to the laſt, ſealing our prayers with an <hi>Amen</hi> of fervent deſire, Faith and truſt.</p>

            <head>PART III. The Chriſtian inſtructed in the practice of ſeveral duties.</head>
            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. I. Of the practical uſe of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Baptiſm.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IT is matter of ſad conſideration, to ſee the ignorance, infidelity, formality, and looſneſs of Baptized <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who live liker unbaptized <hi>Heathens,</hi> than <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Some of the cauſes of this ungodlineſs, are, 1. Some make no more account of Baptiſm, than of a Ceremony; and others aſcribe too great a virtue to the very act or work of Baptizing. And generally there is much curioſity, and expence in preparing for entertainments, where there is little ſenſe of what is to be done in the holy ſolemnity of Baptiſm, by prayer, humiliation, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93290:100"/> faith. 2. The neglect, or negligent, cold, imperfect way, of early, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly education of Baptized Infants. 3. The not improving of our Baptiſm, when we are grown up, for graces, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances, privileges, comforts and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements to God; as if the Laver of Regeneration were a Fountain dried up, or no more to be uſed, than while we are firſt waſhed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I have ſaid before, that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity is a fundamental, practical doctrine, to be explained to all and known of all, becauſe we are all Baptized in the Name of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and of the <hi>Son,</hi> and of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> I am limited to a very ſhort diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and therefore muſt ſay as much in little, as I can in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing points.</p>
               <p>In the form of Baptiſm, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. we have two things; 1. A commiſſion to teach and Baptize. 2. A direction, with commandment, to Baptize in the Name; or, into the Name of the <hi>Father,</hi> of the <hi>Son,</hi> and of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Here obſerve, 1. The Author, or the Lord who gave this Commiſſion, and Command; the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> ver. 18.2. The parties. 1. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter employed, and his office to teach the Goſpel, or Covenant of grace, and to Baptize with Water.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93290:100"/> 2. The principal parties, between whom he deales, and officiates in this ſolemn Act. 1. God, the moſt high and gracious God making, and declaring, a Covenant of grace, and taking ſinful, and undone Man into it. 2. Man gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly taken into Covenant, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully accepting of, and ſubmitting to the grace of God, declared in that Covenant, according to the terms, and conſtitution, or Laws thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To Baptize with Water is a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Act, between God, and the party Baptized. By it God doth graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly admit, and receive a guilty pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted Sinner to himſelf, in Covenant; and the poor polluted Sinner doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and ſubmit to God, upon Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant terms; and Baptizing with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is an outward, viſible, Sign and Seal, by which God doth ſignify his grace, and bind himſelf, as God in Covenant, to perform his gracious promiſes; and the party Baptized, doth declare and ſignify his humble ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of and ſincere conſent to the Covenant of grace, and binds himſelf to perform what God requireth of him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This is done in the Name, or into the name of the Father, the Son, and Holy Ghoſt. Where God doth more fully and clearly, and diſtinctly
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93290:101"/> declare himſelf, than ever he did to <hi>Abraham,</hi> or any of his Covenant Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple before, at leaſt together, and at one time.</p>
               <p n="5">5. According to this declaration of himſelf, as God, the everlaſting, and Almighty (by which name he took <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> into Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1.) the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, he taketh his people for his own, and they take him for their God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And ſo we are related to God, as Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and have a right to him as Father, as he hath to us, as Children; and to him, as Son of the Father, and what the Son hath done for us, as he hath a right to us, as Children, and Brethren, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11,12,13,14. And we have a right, as well as relation to God the Holy Ghoſt and to what he doth, as he hath a right to us, to teach, lead, ſanctify, and dwell in us. We have God enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to us, and we are engaged, and oblig'd to God, the Father, the Son, and Holy Ghoſt, as ſuch.</p>
               <p n="7">7. As God ſaid, <hi>I am the Lord thy God thou ſhalt have no other Gods but me,</hi> binding his Covenant People to himſelf, in which this poſitive duty is implied, <hi>Thou ſhalt have me for thy God;</hi> ſo here, in our Baptiſm, we are enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to have God the Father, the Son,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93290:101"/> and Holy Ghoſt for our God; to have him is both our duty, and happineſs.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Therefore we muſt not take up, and ſatisfy our ſelves, with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and faith of God in general, That God is, or that God is one, the Creator, and Governour of all things, but muſt enlarge our knowledge, and faith into the myſtery of God, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.2. the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and into the marvellous Works of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, Sanctification, and Salvation, in which the grace of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt doth gloriouſly appear.</p>
               <p n="9">9. God, deſcending to us in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and exalting us to be his People, is the higheſt object of our knowledge, faith, fear, love, deſire, delight, hope and truſt: We muſt honour and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, own and obey him, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this revelation as Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>And now I come to ſhew you, that this Doctrine of the Trinity or three Perſons in the God-head, is a practical Doctrine, as well as fundamental, and to be known and believed of all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians:</hi> and then the practical improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptiſm.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us take this Myſtery, as it is revealed to us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And becauſe, it is revealed to us, we ought not to be terrified from a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93290:102"/> ſearch into it. It is plain, 1. That Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, are one God; and that one God in Covenant. 2. Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, are ſeverally Named. 3. Therefore, there is a relation of the one to the other, and a diſtinction between them. 4. There is an order, but no inequality in Eſſence, for we are to honour, and obey the one equally with the other. 5. No doubt but this is for his Glory, that he hath thus declared himſelf, and for the good of his People: and what we cannot now underſtand, we ſhall underſtand in Heaven, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10. 6. Every Baptized Perſon muſt hold faſt the faith, and profeſſion of the Trinity of Perſons in the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible Eſſence and God-head: for every Perſon is declared to be our God, to have a right to us, and we are devoted to them, as one God, and three Perſons. 7. What is brieſly ſumm'd up in this form of Baptiſm, is more particularly explained in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and more diſtinctly in the New Teſtament; therefore, we ought to enquire into the Scriptures, into the common and alſo diſtinct acts, and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations aſcribed to God, as one, and to each one of the moſt Glorious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. 8. In theſe words, we have the foundation, object, rule and meaſure
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93290:102"/> of our holy Faith comprehended. Our Faith is ſounded upon God; he is the higheſt Object of it: Our Faith muſt follow the Order laid down; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the Firſt Perſon, the Son the Second, and the Holy Ghoſt the Third; and the Order of Acts and Operations follows, according to the Order of Subſiſtence; the Father doth all through the Son, by the Spirit; by the Spirit we come, and believe in the Son; and through him, we come to the Father. The Relation of the Three is double; 1. To one another: The Father is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the Son, as a Father; and the Son to the Father, as a Son; and both to the Holy Ghoſt, and the Holy Ghoſt to both, as the Spirit of the Father, and the Sun. 2. To us, who are ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized: He is a Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt to us, that take him for our God. From theſe Names of Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, we come to have right Notions of God, as God of Grace, Love, Authority and Power; and of our own Relation and Obligation to him for all Grace and Mercy, and our Dependance on him, and Obedience to him, as Children. Laſtly, Here is the true Meaſure of our Faith concerning God: Our Faith is defective, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound, if we do not believe in one God, the Father, the Son, and Holy Ghoſt.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93290:103"/> The Knowledge of this great Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is very neceſſary, and of great uſe to us; 1. In reſpect of our Faith, and Life of Faith. 2. To direct us in our right worſhipping of God. 3. In our univerſal new Obedience. And indeed, the Myſtery of the Incarnation, and the whole of our Redemption and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, doth ſpring from the Myſtery of the Trinity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We muſt exerciſe Faith in God the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.24. —<hi>And believeth on him that ſent me,</hi> Joh. 14.1. as the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Grace, Father of Mercies, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.2,3. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3. as teaching, and drawing to Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44,45. lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.27. as the Father of Chriſt, and our Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.17. 2. We muſt exerciſe Faith in Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.1. <hi>Believe alſo in me;</hi> as the only Begotten of the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.31. as the Way to the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.6. as having Eternal Life in him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.11,12. It is an Obſervation of great moment, that the Mediatory Offices of Chriſt are grounded upon, and have their Efficacy from the Sonſhip of the Second Perſon. The Son took our Nature, and was conſecrated to be our High Prieſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.28. The Son is our all-wiſe, and mighty Prophet, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.5. and our King, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.6,7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1,8. The Son hath all
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93290:103"/> Power and Authority with the Father, and therefore we may draw near to him with Faith and Confidence of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation and Prevailing. 3 We muſt believe in the Holy Ghoſt. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe in the Father, and the Son, except we believe in the Holy Ghoſt: His Wiſdom, and his Power, is the Wiſdom and Power of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4,5. We cannot believe the Scripture, except we believe in him, by whoſe Inſpiration the Scriptures were ſpoken and written, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. Our Faith doth depend upon his Teſtimony, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.6. He is a Witneſs, both in Heaven and Earth, <hi>Ver.</hi> 7,8. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, as a Witneſs, a Teacher, a Comforter, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.26.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We cannot worſhip God In Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit acceptably, except we believe in the Father, the Son, and Holy Ghoſt. That one Text is of ſingular uſe to Believers, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.18. <hi>For through him</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſt, the Mediator) <hi>we have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs by one Spirit</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Holy Ghoſt) <hi>unto the Father.</hi> And thus we worſhip the Father, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.24. the Son, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.23. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6,11. and the Holy Ghoſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14. Prayer is made to the Holy Ghoſt, as well as to the Father, and the Son: Sometimes Prayer hath been made to one, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.14. ſometimes to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93290:104"/> 
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 7.59. ſometimes to two, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.11,13. and ſometimes the three are named, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14. But when one is only named, the other are not excluded. What need have we to be renewed in the Spirit of our Minds, that we may have divine and ſpiritual Thoughts and Conceptions of God, in our Approaches to him?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Univerſal Obedience and Service is to be performed to the Father, the Son, and Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.6. Compare 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 6.18. with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall do the Will of my Father which is in Heaven,</hi> Matth. 12.50. The Son muſt be honoured and obeyed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.23. <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14,15. And the Holy Ghoſt is to be ſerved and obeyed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. from 9. to 15. We muſt obey his Motions, Teachings, Reproofs, Convictions and Commands.</p>
               <p>So much of the firſt Head: Now of the ſecond: <hi>We are enabled by the Spirit, accepted through the Son, with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Improvement of our Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm: Conſider two things; 1. All Perſons baptized, are bound to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their Baptiſm for their own Good, and Glory of God. 2. Parents ought to improve it for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And then I ſhall ſhew in what
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93290:104"/> Particulars, and how this Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Advantage of Baptiſm is to be made.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Baptiſm is a Bond made between God and us. As by Circumciſion, the <hi>Jews</hi> were bound to obſerve the whole Law, though it was an Ordinance gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3: <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.7,10, to 13. ſo Chriſtians are Debtors to Chriſt, to obſerve all things commanded by him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Abraham</hi> was bound for himſelf to walk before God, <hi>&amp;c.

               <p n="2">2. All Perſons are bound for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when grown up to Years of Underſtanding, to remember this Bond and Covenant, ſolemnly entred with God. Though they have neglected the Duties required, and have not humbly claimed the Privileges of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-People, yet the Bond is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Bond, and the Tranſgreſſion of it will be charged upon them, to their ſorer Condemnation, if they repent not. I ſay, all baptized Perſons are
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93290:105" rendition="simple:additions"/> obliged to God, and muſt remember their Covenant, whether they be, 1. Unconverted: Or, 2. Converted, and called.</p>

And then, how might the Conſideration of their being baptized, of the nature and obligation of Baptiſm, work them towards Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and Reformation? Reaſoning thus with themſelves:</p>
               <p n="1">1. I am not mine own, but God's: I am dedicated and joined to him by Covenant: It is both my Glory, and my Duty to be the Lord's. Shall I, who am related to the moſt high God, as a Child, turn to be a Child of the Devil? Shall I, who am redeemed with precious Blood, ſell my ſelf to Sin, and become a Slave? Shall I, who am baptized into the Holy Ghoſt, the Spirit of Sanctification, defile my ſelf, and drown my ſelf in the mire of Sin? The Sons of God are lead by the Spirit of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. Am I God's, or am I not? If not, What? Oh, what will become of me for ever? 2. I am waſhed with Water, and I muſt be waſhed with Blood and Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; or elſe I cannot enter into the Kingdom of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3,5. Nothing that defileth, ſhall enter therein, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.27. Oh, waſh me throughly, and cleanſe me from my
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93290:106"/> Sin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.2. 3. When you are convinced of the neceſſity of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, improve your Baptiſm towards it. Say then, 1. I am baptized into the Father, who is the Father of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and God of all Grace; who teacheth, calleth, draweth and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth returning Prodigals. O Father of Mercies, make me a Child: Oh, draw me, call me, meet me, receive me. Thou art my God by Covenant, thy Sign and Seal is upon me: Oh, forſake me not, but put thy Spirit within me. 2. I am baptized into the Name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, who came into the World to ſave Sinners, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. Oh, redeem me by thy Power, from this Bondage, from Sin, Satan, and the evil World: Oh, waſh me by the Merits, and Efficacy of thy Blood, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. Oh, bring me home, a Stray-Sheep! Seek me, and ſave me. Be thou my Peace, and my Advocate. 3. I am baptized into the Holy Ghoſt, the Spirit of Light, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Life, Sanctification and Holineſs. Oh, make me a new Creature; waſh me, according to thy Grace and Power, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13.

               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:93290:106"/>
               <p n="2">2. Let all ſuch as are regenerate, and called, remember their Baptiſm; 1. By way of Thankfulneſs and Praiſe to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, for Grace and Love, that God is their God, and that they are his People; that they have obtained Mercy. They may go ſo high as Election, and praiſe God as the Apoſtle doth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3. to 8. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.2,3,4. How happy are you in ſuch a Father, ſuch a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, ſuch a Comforter; and that you are under Grace, and made ſafe by Covenant? 2. Improve Baptiſm for Grace, and Growth in Grace and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; 1. Becauſe you are ſeparated to God, as an holy God, and are joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Covenant; and therefore are not Debtors to the Fleſh, to live after the Fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.12. We are bought with a price, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. and joined to the Lord, and therefore are one Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. one Mind, one Will, one Aim, one Way and End. 2. Becauſe you are crucified with Chriſt, therefore we ſhould be holy; ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.14. By virtue of our Union with Chriſt, we muſt go on to mortifie Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3. and live to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. from 4. to 13. By this we have great and effectual Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and are under the ſtrongeſt Engagements to Holineſs.</p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:93290:107"/>
               <p n="3">3. Improve your Baptiſm for Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, which are exceeding great and high: As, 1. Apply it for your Acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation with God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.6. Though we are vile and hateful in our ſelves, yet we are beloved of the Father, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in the beloved Son, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Spirit. 2. Apply it for Juſtification and Reconciliation. The Father will not condemn them, for whom his Son died: The Father will not be wroth with them that believe, and are in him, in whom he is well pleaſed. The Terrour of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is taken off by the Holy Ghoſt the Comforter. 3. Apply it for Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and the Privileges and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted Children have the Spirit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, and the Earneſt of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.30. and all things with Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. 4. Improve it for Communion with God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. What may not a Child have, that is fit and good for him, from a Father, and ſuch a Father? as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3. that comes to him in his Son's Name, and hath the Son to be an Advocate for him, and the Spirit to make Interceſſion in him? See <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.26,27. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. You may be bold for a Child's Portion in Covenant, that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:93290:107"/> have the Heart and Spirit of a Child.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Improve your Baptiſmal Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Father, the Son, and Holy Ghoſt, for Aſſurance. The great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is, that God will be our God, All-ſufficient for all things, and all times. What Circumciſion was, Baptiſm is: See <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11,12. Say then, you have the Seal of God ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to his Promiſe: Oh, ſhew it, and plead it, for Confirmation and Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Pardon, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. <hi>Chap.</hi> 22.14. and all other Bleſſings.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Improve Baptiſm for your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance and Conſtancy in Duty and Obedience, againſt all Temptations to Apoſtacy. Make quick Denials to the Importunities of the Fleſh, World and Devil. Say, What have I to do with thee, Satan? Get thee hence. I am baptized, I am delivered and redeemed from thee, and ſworn in Covenant againſt thee. I am a Soldier of Chriſt; in his Name, by his Authority and Power, I will reſiſt thee. I will not turn away from Chriſt, nor be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous to him, and mine own Soul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Say to the World, I am cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to thee; what have I to do with thee? The Lord is my Portion. Go, tempt and allure them that know thee not, and that have their Treaſure up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth. I am dead to thee: But,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:93290:108"/> Lord, there is none in Heaven but thee, and none upon Earth beſides thee, <hi>&amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 73.25. Say to the Fleſh, I am redeemed, I am joined to the Lord: Shall I take the Members of Chriſt, and make them Members of an Harlot? God forbid. How ſhall I ſerve ſin, that am freed from it? To this End, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, 1. To whom thou art enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: Thou art married in Covenant to the Lord; thou art to honour thy Father in Heaven, who is better than all, above all; thou art a redeemed Servant, and Member of Chriſt; thou art related and engaged to the Holy Spirit. 2. Remember the nature of thy Obligation; it is a ſolemn Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, an Engagement of the higheſt nature. 3. It is a Pre-engagement; thou art promiſed to God firſt, and wilt not be falſe. 4. It is an unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Mercy, Honour and Bleſſing to be Sons and Daughters in Covenant with God: Will you forfeit it? 5. Your preſent and future Happineſs depends upon your obſerving, loving, honouring, ſerving God, and walking before him. 6. God will judge you by his Son Chriſt, in the laſt Day: And what will he do to them in that Day, who are aſhamed of him now? Oh! re-turn, and repent, ye Revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:93290:108"/>
               <p>Laſtly, Improve your Baptiſmal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and Covenant, by Mediation, by Prayer, by Thankſgiving, by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion at his Table; and all by Faith, with Love and Reverence. Let it not be a ſmall thing in your Eyes to be the Sons and Daughters of the Almighty God, who is a great King.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Improve your Baptiſm for others; Parents for your Children, 1. Before they are baptized. 2. After they are baptized.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Before: From the Water of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, learn and lay to heart groſs Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and Corruption; ſuch as no Soap or Nitre, no Tears, or Blood, or Righteouſneſs of our own could purge away. 2. Bleſs God heartily for the Blood of Jeſus, and the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Spirit. 3. See the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and Benefit thereof. 4. And then addreſs your ſelves to God, as Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, for your Seed. 1. Beg that the Infant may be taken into the Covenant of Grace, with you. 2. That the Child may ever continue under the Grace, and in the Duty of the Covenant. 3. Pray for the inward Grace, and reſt not in the outward Privilege. To that end, 1. Be ſenſible of the ſinful Defilement, Death and Miſery of the Infant by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Humble your Souls in the Sight
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:93290:109"/> of God, under the Conſideration of it. 2. Look unto the Promiſe, or free Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and the part that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants have in it, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. and the Grace expreſſed by Chriſt, to Infants, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. Exerciſe Faith in the free Grace and Love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Love and Redemption of the Son, the Grace and Power of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt. 4. Do not look upon Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm as an empty Sign, but as an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, eſtabliſhed by a Word of Command, and Promiſe, for great Ends, and of great Efficacy to thoſe Ends, by the Operation of the Spirit. It is not a Sign of nothing, nor a Seal of nothing; but look to the Grace of it. 5. Taking Encouragement from Free Grace, apply your ſelves to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son and Holy Ghoſt, for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, by earneſt Prayer: The matter of which may be, 1. That God would be ſo merciful, as to receive the Infant to Baptiſm. 2. That God would be his Father, Redeemer and Sanctifier; and be his God, according to the Grace of every Relation. 3. That the poor Infant may be taken out of the old cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Stock, and planted into Chriſt, ſo as to receive Life and Nouriſhment from him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. That he may, in time, have Faith, and the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, the Privileges of a Child, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:93290:109"/> the Grace to continue in the Duties. 5. That he may never turn after the Fleſh, World and Devil; or if he do, that he may return to God, in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and never revolt again. 6. Look upon the Grace, and the Obligation of Baptiſm together; the Grace, and the Duty. Water in Baptiſm is as ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant and conducive to its End, as Bread and Wine in the Lord's Supper.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Improve Baptiſm for them that are baptized: Thus, 1. Reſpect your Infants, as the Children of God, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to your Charge for Education, as more God's than yours. Make a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between them, and the Breed of Inſidels, Atheiſts, Worldlings and Devils. 2. Continue in fervent Prayers for them from their Infancy. 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to inſtruct them, and train them up for God, as you feed them; plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, frequently, ſeaſonably, ſenſibly. They will ſoon take notice of things which they ſee; of the Moon and Stars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Make known to them the inviſible God, his Wiſdom, Power, Goodneſs and Providence. 4. As they grow in Capacity, labour to fill them, and labour that Knowledge may enter into their Souls: Make frequent Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to them, when you are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with their Comelineſs, Beauty, Features, Actions, Speeches, and how
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93290:110"/> pretty they are when dreſs'd: Make ſpiritual uſe of theſe things to your ſelves and them. 5. Take Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from their Baptiſm to plead for them with God; 1. When you obſerve them to be dull and backward to Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and forward to Naughtineſs; when you ſee them negligent, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, untractable, and are afraid of them. Oh, ſay, as you mourn to God, <hi>This Child is dedicated to thee, in Covenant with thee. Oh, make him thine own: Work upon his Soul what I cannot: Give what I have not to give: Teach him, redeem him, convert him, ſanctifie him, rule him: O thou who didſt once receive him, do not now reject him.</hi> 2. When you are croſs'd and afflicted, contend with them for God upon Covenant-Engagement, and plead with God for them upon Covenant-Mercies and Promiſes. Shew unto them what an Honour, Liberty, Mercy it is to be God's Covenant-child; how much they are obliged to keep Covenant with the Heavenly Father, Son and Spirit; how happy it will be for them in the great Day to be called, <hi>Ye bleſſed of the Father;</hi> and how terrible it will be to depart as curſed Revolters, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous Unbelievers, and impenitent Workers of Iniquity, to be tormented in Everlaſting Fire, with the Devil and his Angels. <hi>The Lord teach you to profit.</hi>

But thoſe who cannot attain to that Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Boldneſs, may uſe ſo much of the Prayer every Day, as is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſome ſpecial Occaſions; as that for the Lord's Day, and that before the Sacrament, and that before Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word; and leaving theſe out of the ordinary Courſe, to their proper Seaſons, the reſt may be drawn together, to ſerve either for Morning, or Evening, or any other convenient time.</p>

So then, you ſee the Bread and Wine, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Body and Blood of Chriſt, ſignified and repreſented by them. When you ſee the Bread and Wine ſo bleſſed to this bleſſed End, you muſt believe and know that the Redeemer and all his Benefits are communicated to you.

Truly, to ſee many depart, who have been earneſtly invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this Feaſt of Love, hath brought to my Mind the Separation that will be

               <p n="1">1. I beſeech you to conſider the great and gracious Condeſcention of the moſt high and holy God, to reveal to you the great Myſtery of Redemption by his beloved Son; and to make it plain, and to confirm weak Faith, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it by ſenſible Signs. The Bread and Wine admoniſh you of the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Chriſt, without whom you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live; and of the Benefit of Chriſt,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:93290:145"/> whoſe Effect is ſpiritual Nouriſhment, and Growth in Grace. You have need of this plain way of Information, by ſenſible Signs: God ſtoops very low therein; neglect it not.

               <p n="2">2. Conſider once again what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to your Souls by theſe viſible Signs.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Is it not profitable for you to ſee Jeſus Chriſt, and all the Benefits of Redemption ſet before you?

He offers him; yea, gives; yea, ſeals the Gift of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Life, to make it ſure to you for ever, if you will but take, and receive, as he hath appointed you. And what can be more to you than Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and the Purchace of his

Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if he enjoined it to them who had been trained up in his Doctrine, known his Life, ſeen his Miracles; how gracious is God to us, in appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us ſuch an Help, who have more need of ſuch repeated Confirmations of his Grace? Can you do as well without? Or what need you care to have your Graces ſtrengthned, or Forgiveneſs ſealed? Can you be ſo unthankful, and cold in your Love, as to neglect to remember him, in a Way of his own Appointment? Or would you be ſo careleſs to have the Act of Oblivion ſealed by the Great Seal, and to be ſure of Life? Or are you ſo rich, that you can be without a part in the Everlaſting Covenant? Is he a Child of God, that never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires for the Legacy bequeathed by Will?

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:93290:149"/> preaching of Chriſt is but a dry thing, of no power upon thy Heart; that there is not that Good to be had by Communion with Chriſt, that we ſay there is. In a word, Thou art back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to renew thy Covenant in thine own Perſon, in thy riper Years; and wouldeſt be as ſlack to be baptized, if it were now to be done, as thou art to eat the Lord's Supper; for both are Seals and Signs of the ſame Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: And by conſequence, thou art backward to become a Chriſtian.

               <p>In a word; Thou haſt no Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Father, in his Love; with Chriſt, in his Merits; with the Holy Ghoſt, in his Grace and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; nor with the Saints of God, in Love, and heavenly Privileges. Oh, what a Loſs and Diſadvantage is this! Conſider what I ſay, and reſolve, by the Grace of God, againſt affected Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, ſpiritual and killing Sloth and Eaſe; againſt Unbelief, and Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heart, ſhrinking from thy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, Vow and Promiſe; and ſee that thou ſin no more, by Omiſſion of this great Duty, and Neglect of this high Privilege, nor by an unworthy Eating and Drinking: But hunger and thirſt after Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be
